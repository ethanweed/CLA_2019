Transcription in CHAT
========================================================

>- Transcripts are written in a text editor and stored as unformatted ASCII files (text only or plain text).

>- All lines are ended by a carriage return (ENTER).

>- Every transcript must begin with the line: @BEGIN and end with the line: @End.

>- Between @BEGIN and @End:
	– headers with information about the transcript (obligatory: @Participants)
	>– main tier for transcription
	>– dependent tiers for further annotations

CHAT-Format: Basic Structure
========================================================

- @BEGIN
- @Participants
- [other headers]
- *JOE: [spoken material]
- %mor: [morpho-syntactic coding] - *INT: [spoken material]
- %mor: [morpho-syntactic coding] - @End

CHAT-Format: Headers
========================================================
- three letters followed by a colon and a tab
- obligatory: @ Participants, on the second
line of the transcript; e.g.:
@Participants: JOE Joe child, INT Interviewer
- optional; e.g.: –@BirthofLearner: ... –@AgeofLearner: ... –@Date: ... –@Language: ... –@Transcriber: ...



CHAT-Format: Main Tiers
========================================================
- what was actually said, one utterance per tier
- introduced by "*", the three-letter code for the
participant and a tab; e.g.:
*JOE: the boy put the leash on the cat.
- orthographical transcription in lower case Latin
letters; except for proper nouns (e.g. John)
and "I"
- numbers spelled out (ten, not 10)
- normalisation of phonetically deviant forms
(phonetic information about forms can be presented on a %pho dependent tier)



Main Tiers: Markers
========================================================
- unfilled pauses: #
- filled pauses: eh@fp
- interruption: +/.
- self-interruption: +//.
- repetition w/o correction: [/]
- repetition with correction: [//]
- unintelligible speech: xxx
- material coded on phonol. tier: yyy
- doubtful material: [?] or [=? text] - omitted parts of words: ( ) •torefertomorethanoneword: <>



CHAT: Dependent Tiers
========================================================
further annotations, e.g.  

• %mor
• %pho
• %syn
• %err
• %com
• %spa
[morphosyntactic coding] [phonological coding] [syntactic coding] [errors]
CHAT: Dependent Tiers
further annotations, e.g.
[comments] [speech acts]
