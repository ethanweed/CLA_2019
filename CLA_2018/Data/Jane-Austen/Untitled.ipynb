      "one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by\n",
      "contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any\n",
      "unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs changed naturally\n",
      "into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations\n",
      "of the last century; and there, if every other leaf were powerless, he\n",
      "could read his own history with an interest which never failed.  This\n",
      "was the page at which the favourite volume always opened:\n",

      "\n",
      "Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer's\n",
      "hands; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of\n",
      "himself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary's birth--\n",
      "\"Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles Musgrove,\n",

      "Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character;\n",
      "vanity of person and of situation.  He had been remarkably handsome in\n",
      "his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man.  Few women\n",
      "could think more of their personal appearance than he did, nor could\n",
      "the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held\n",
      "in society.  He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to\n",
      "the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot, who united\n",
      "these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect and\n",
      "devotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment; since\n",
      "to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any\n",
      "thing deserved by his own.  Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman,\n",
      "sensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be\n",
      "pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot, had never\n",
      "required indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured, or softened, or\n",
      "concealed his failings, and promoted his real respectability for\n",
      "seventeen years; and though not the very happiest being in the world\n",
      "herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends, and her children,\n",
      "to attach her to life, and make it no matter of indifference to her\n",
      "when she was called on to quit them.--Three girls, the two eldest\n",
      "sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath, an\n",
      "awful charge rather, to confide to the authority and guidance of a\n",
      "conceited, silly father.  She had, however, one very intimate friend, a\n",
      "sensible, deserving woman, who had been brought, by strong attachment\n",
      "to herself, to settle close by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on\n",
      "her kindness and advice, Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help\n",
      "and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had\n",
      "been anxiously giving her daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "This friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been\n",
      "anticipated on that head by their acquaintance.  Thirteen years had\n",
      "passed away since Lady Elliot's death, and they were still near\n",
      "neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower, the other\n",
      "a widow.\n",
      "\n",
      "That Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely well\n",
      "provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage, needs no\n",
      "apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably\n",
      "discontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not; but\n",
      "Sir Walter's continuing in singleness requires explanation.  Be it\n",
      "known then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with one\n",
      "or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),\n",
      "prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters' sake.  For\n",
      "one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing,\n",
      "which he had not been very much tempted to do.  Elizabeth had\n",
      "succeeded, at sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother's rights\n",
      "and consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself, her\n",
      "influence had always been great, and they had gone on together most\n",
      "happily.  His two other children were of very inferior value.  Mary had\n",
      "acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming Mrs Charles\n",
      "Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness of\n",
      "character, which must have placed her high with any people of real\n",
      "understanding, was nobody with either father or sister; her word had no\n",
      "weight, her convenience was always to give way--she was only Anne.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Lady Russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued\n",
      "god-daughter, favourite, and friend.  Lady Russell loved them all; but\n",
      "it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her\n",
      "bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height, her father had\n",
      "found little to admire in her, (so totally different were her delicate\n",
      "features and mild dark eyes from his own), there could be nothing in\n",
      "them, now that she was faded and thin, to excite his esteem. He had\n",
      "never indulged much hope, he had now none, of ever reading her name in\n",
      "any other page of his favourite work.  All equality of alliance must\n",
      "rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely connected herself with an old\n",
      "country family of respectability and large fortune, and had therefore\n",
      "given all the honour and received none: Elizabeth would, one day or\n",
      "other, marry suitably.\n",
      "\n",
      "It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than she\n",
      "was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been\n",
      "neither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely\n",
      "any charm is lost.  It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome\n",
      "Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter\n",
      "might be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least, be\n",
      "deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming\n",
      "as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else; for he\n",
      "could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance\n",
      "were growing.  Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face in the\n",
      "neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow's foot about\n",
      "Lady Russell's temples had long been a distress to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment.\n",
      "Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and\n",
      "directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have\n",
      "given the idea of her being younger than she was.  For thirteen years\n",
      "had she been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at\n",
      "home, and leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking\n",
      "immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and\n",
      "dining-rooms in the country.  Thirteen winters' revolving frosts had\n",
      "seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood\n",
      "afforded, and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms, as she travelled\n",
      "up to London with her father, for a few weeks' annual enjoyment of the\n",
      "great world.  She had the remembrance of all this, she had the\n",
      "consciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and\n",
      "some apprehensions; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as\n",
      "handsome as ever, but she felt her approach to the years of danger, and\n",
      "would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by\n",
      "baronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two.  Then might she again\n",
      "take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth,\n",
      "but now she liked it not.  Always to be presented with the date of her\n",
      "own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,\n",
      "made the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it\n",
      "open on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes, and\n",
      "pushed it away.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book, and especially\n",
      "the history of her own family, must ever present the remembrance of.\n",
      "The heir presumptive, the very William Walter Elliot, Esq., whose\n",
      "rights had been so generously supported by her father, had disappointed\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be,\n",
      "in the event of her having no brother, the future baronet, meant to\n",
      "marry him, and her father had always meant that she should.  He had not\n",
      "been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot's death, Sir\n",
      "Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures had not\n",
      "been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it, making\n",
      "allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of their\n",
      "spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom, Mr\n",
      "Elliot had been forced into the introduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the\n",
      "law; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his\n",
      "favour was confirmed.  He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked\n",
      "of and expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.  The\n",
      "following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,\n",
      "again encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come; and\n",
      "the next tidings were that he was married.  Instead of pushing his\n",
      "fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot, he\n",
      "had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of\n",
      "inferior birth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Walter had resented it.  As the head of the house, he felt that he\n",
      "ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man so\n",
      "publicly by the hand; \"For they must have been seen together,\" he\n",
      "observed, \"once at Tattersall's, and twice in the lobby of the House of\n",
      "Commons.\"  His disapprobation was expressed, but apparently very little\n",
      "regarded.  Mr Elliot had attempted no apology, and shewn himself as\n",
      "unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family, as Sir Walter\n",
      "considered him unworthy of it:  all acquaintance between them had\n",
      "ceased.\n",
      "\n",
      "This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval of\n",
      "several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man for\n",
      "himself, and still more for being her father's heir, and whose strong\n",
      "family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter\n",
      "Elliot's eldest daughter.  There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her\n",
      "feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.  Yet so\n",
      "miserably had he conducted himself, that though she was at this present\n",
      "time (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons for his wife, she could\n",
      "not admit him to be worth thinking of again.  The disgrace of his first\n",
      "marriage might, perhaps, as there was no reason to suppose it\n",
      "perpetuated by offspring, have been got over, had he not done worse;\n",
      "but he had, as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends, they\n",
      "had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully of them all, most\n",
      "slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to, and\n",
      "the honours which were hereafter to be his own.  This could not be\n",
      "pardoned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such were Elizabeth Elliot's sentiments and sensations; such the cares\n",
      "to alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance, the\n",
      "prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life; such the feelings\n",
      "to give interest to a long, uneventful residence in one country circle,\n",
      "to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad, no\n",
      "talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be\n",
      "added to these.  Her father was growing distressed for money.  She\n",
      "knew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive the\n",
      "heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of Mr\n",
      "Shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.  The Kellynch property was\n",
      "good, but not equal to Sir Walter's apprehension of the state required\n",
      "in its possessor.  While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method,\n",
      "moderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income; but\n",
      "with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period he\n",
      "had been constantly exceeding it.  It had not been possible for him to\n",
      "spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was\n",
      "imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was not only\n",
      "growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often, that it\n",
      "became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially, from his\n",
      "daughter.  He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town;\n",
      "he had gone so far even as to say, \"Can we retrench?  Does it occur to\n",
      "you that there is any one article in which we can retrench?\" and\n",
      "Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first ardour of female alarm,\n",
      "set seriously to think what could be done, and had finally proposed\n",
      "these two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities,\n",
      "and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room; to which\n",
      "expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no\n",
      "present down to Anne, as had been the usual yearly custom.  But these\n",
      "measures, however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real\n",
      "extent of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged\n",
      "to confess to her soon afterwards.  Elizabeth had nothing to propose of\n",
      "deeper efficacy.  She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate, as did her\n",
      "father; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of\n",
      "lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity, or\n",
      "relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose\n",
      "of; but had every acre been alienable, it would have made no\n",
      "difference.  He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the\n",
      "power, but he would never condescend to sell.  No; he would never\n",
      "disgrace his name so far.  The Kellynch estate should be transmitted\n",
      "whole and entire, as he had received it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in the\n",
      "neighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them;\n",
      "and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be\n",
      "struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and\n",
      "reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of any indulgence\n",
      "of taste or pride.\n",

      "Mr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold\n",
      "or his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable prompted\n",
      "by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint, and\n",
      "only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent\n",
      "judgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense he fully\n",

      "quick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this\n",
      "instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.\n",
      "She was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour;\n",
      "but she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter's feelings, as solicitous\n",

      "most correct in her conduct, strict in her notions of decorum, and with\n",
      "manners that were held a standard of good-breeding.  She had a\n",
      "cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking, rational and consistent;\n",
      "but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry; she had a value for\n",
      "rank and consequence, which blinded her a little to the faults of those\n",
      "who possessed them.  Herself the widow of only a knight, she gave the\n",
      "dignity of a baronet all its due; and Sir Walter, independent of his\n",
      "claims as an old acquaintance, an attentive neighbour, an obliging\n",
      "landlord, the husband of her very dear friend, the father of Anne and\n",

      "They must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.  But she was very\n",

      "question. She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her in\n",
      "marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to\n",

      "regulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope we may be able\n",
      "to convince him and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has a respectability\n",
      "in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions; and that the\n",
      "true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the\n",
      "eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.  What will\n",
      "he be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families have\n",
      "done, or ought to do?  There will be nothing singular in his case; and\n",
      "it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering, as\n",
      "it always does of our conduct.  I have great hope of prevailing.  We\n",
      "must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who has\n",
      "contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to the\n",
      "feelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father,\n",
      "there is still more due to the character of an honest man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be\n",
      "proceeding, his friends to be urging him.  She considered it as an act\n",
      "of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all\n",
      "the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure,\n",
      "and saw no dignity in anything short of it.  She wanted it to be\n",
      "prescribed, and felt as a duty.  She rated Lady Russell's influence\n",
      "highly; and as to the severe degree of self-denial which her own\n",
      "conscience prompted, she believed there might be little more difficulty\n",
      "in persuading them to a complete, than to half a reformation.  Her\n",
      "knowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the\n",
      "sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of\n",
      "both, and so on, through the whole list of Lady Russell's too gentle\n",
      "reductions.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Anne's more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little\n",
      "consequence.  Lady Russell's had no success at all: could not be put up\n",
      "with, were not to be borne. \"What! every comfort of life knocked off!\n",
      "Journeys, London, servants, horses, table--contractions and\n",
      "restrictions every where!  To live no longer with the decencies even of\n",
      "a private gentleman!  No, he would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once,\n",
      "than remain in it on such disgraceful terms.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quit Kellynch Hall.\"  The hint was immediately taken up by Mr\n",
      "Shepherd, whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter's\n",
      "retrenching, and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done\n",
      "without a change of abode.  \"Since the idea had been started in the\n",
      "very quarter which ought to dictate, he had no scruple,\" he said, \"in\n",
      "confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side.  It did not\n",
      "appear to him that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of\n",
      "living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient\n",
      "dignity to support.  In any other place Sir Walter might judge for\n",
      "himself; and would be looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in\n",
      "whatever way he might choose to model his household.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more of\n",
      "doubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go was\n",
      "settled, and the first outline of this important change made out.\n",
      "\n",
      "There had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house in\n",
      "the country.  All Anne's wishes had been for the latter.  A small house\n",
      "in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have Lady Russell's\n",
      "society, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure of sometimes\n",
      "seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object of her\n",
      "ambition.  But the usual fate of Anne attended her, in having something\n",
      "very opposite from her inclination fixed on.  She disliked Bath, and\n",
      "did not think it agreed with her; and Bath was to be her home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd felt\n",
      "that he could not be trusted in London, and had been skilful enough to\n",
      "dissuade him from it, and make Bath preferred.  It was a much safer\n",
      "place for a gentleman in his predicament:  he might there be important\n",
      "at comparatively little expense.  Two material advantages of Bath over\n",
      "London had of course been given all their weight:  its more convenient\n",
      "distance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell's spending\n",
      "some part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction of\n",
      "Lady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been for\n",
      "Bath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should\n",
      "lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne's known wishes.  It\n",
      "would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house in\n",
      "his own neighbourhood.  Anne herself would have found the\n",
      "mortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to Sir Walter's\n",
      "feelings they must have been dreadful.  And with regard to Anne's\n",
      "dislike of Bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,\n",
      "first, from the circumstance of her having been three years at school\n",
      "there, after her mother's death; and secondly, from her happening to be\n",
      "not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards\n",
      "spent there with herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think it must\n",
      "suit them all; and as to her young friend's health, by passing all the\n",
      "warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge, every danger would be avoided;\n",
      "and it was in fact, a change which must do both health and spirits\n",
      "good.  Anne had been too little from home, too little seen. Her spirits\n",
      "were not high.  A larger society would improve them.  She wanted her to\n",
      "be more known.\n",
      "\n",
      "The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for\n",
      "Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part, and a very\n",
      "material part of the scheme, which had been happily engrafted on the\n",
      "beginning.  He was not only to quit his home, but to see it in the\n",
      "hands of others; a trial of fortitude, which stronger heads than Sir\n",
      "Walter's have found too much.  Kellynch Hall was to be let.  This,\n",
      "however, was a profound secret, not to be breathed beyond their own\n",
      "circle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to\n",
      "design letting his house.  Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word\n",
      "\"advertise,\" but never dared approach it again.  Sir Walter spurned the\n",
      "idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint\n",
      "being dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on the\n",
      "supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most\n",
      "unexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour,\n",
      "that he would let it at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "How quick come the reasons for approving what we like!  Lady Russell\n",
      "had another excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sir\n",
      "Walter and his family were to remove from the country.  Elizabeth had\n",
      "been lately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted.\n",
      "It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned, after an\n",
      "unprosperous marriage, to her father's house, with the additional\n",
      "burden of two children.  She was a clever young woman, who understood\n",
      "the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least, at Kellynch Hall;\n",
      "and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot, as to have been\n",
      "already staying there more than once, in spite of all that Lady\n",
      "Russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place, could hint of\n",
      "caution and reserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth, and\n",
      "seemed to love her, rather because she would love her, than because\n",
      "Elizabeth deserved it.  She had never received from her more than\n",
      "outward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance; had\n",
      "never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry, against\n",
      "previous inclination.  She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying\n",
      "to get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open to all the\n",
      "injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut\n",
      "her out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth\n",
      "the advantage of her own better judgement and experience; but always in\n",
      "vain:  Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she pursued it in\n",
      "more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs\n",
      "Clay; turning from the society of so deserving a sister, to bestow her\n",
      "affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her\n",
      "but the object of distant civility.\n",
      "\n",
      "From situation, Mrs Clay was, in Lady Russell's estimate, a very\n",
      "unequal, and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion;\n",
      "and a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind, and bring a choice of\n",
      "more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot's reach, was therefore an\n",
      "object of first-rate importance.\n",

      "\"I must take leave to observe, Sir Walter,\" said Mr Shepherd one\n",
      "morning at Kellynch Hall, as he laid down the newspaper, \"that the\n",
      "present juncture is much in our favour.  This peace will be turning all\n",
      "our rich naval officers ashore.  They will be all wanting a home.\n",
      "Could not be a better time, Sir Walter, for having a choice of tenants,\n",
      "very responsible tenants.  Many a noble fortune has been made during\n",
      "the war.  If a rich admiral were to come in our way, Sir Walter--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He would be a very lucky man, Shepherd,\" replied Sir Walter; \"that's\n",
      "all I have to remark.  A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall be to him;\n",
      "rather the greatest prize of all, let him have taken ever so many\n",
      "before; hey, Shepherd?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Shepherd laughed, as he knew he must, at this wit, and then added--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I presume to observe, Sir Walter, that, in the way of business,\n",
      "gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with.  I have had a little\n",
      "knowledge of their methods of doing business; and I am free to confess\n",
      "that they have very liberal notions, and are as likely to make\n",
      "desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with.\n",
      "Therefore, Sir Walter, what I would take leave to suggest is, that if\n",
      "in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention; which\n",
      "must be contemplated as a possible thing, because we know how difficult\n",
      "it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the\n",
      "notice and curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, John\n",
      "Shepherd, might conceal any family-matters that I chose, for nobody\n",
      "would think it worth their while to observe me; but Sir Walter Elliot\n",
      "has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude; and\n",
      "therefore, thus much I venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise\n",
      "me if, with all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get\n",
      "abroad; in the supposition of which, as I was going to observe, since\n",
      "applications will unquestionably follow, I should think any from our\n",
      "wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave\n",
      "to add, that two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you the\n",
      "trouble of replying.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Walter only nodded.  But soon afterwards, rising and pacing the\n",
      "room, he observed sarcastically--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who would\n",
      "not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,\"\n",
      "said Mrs Clay, for Mrs Clay was present:  her father had driven her\n",
      "over, nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay's health as a drive to\n",
      "Kellynch: \"but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might\n",
      "be a very desirable tenant.  I have known a good deal of the\n",
      "profession; and besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful\n",
      "in all their ways!  These valuable pictures of yours, Sir Walter, if\n",
      "you chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe.  Everything in and\n",
      "about the house would be taken such excellent care of!  The gardens and\n",
      "shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now.  You\n",
      "need not be afraid, Miss Elliot, of your own sweet flower gardens being\n",
      "neglected.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As to all that,\" rejoined Sir Walter coolly, \"supposing I were induced\n",
      "to let my house, I have by no means made up my mind as to the\n",
      "privileges to be annexed to it.  I am not particularly disposed to\n",
      "favour a tenant.  The park would be open to him of course, and few navy\n",
      "officers, or men of any other description, can have had such a range;\n",
      "but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the\n",
      "pleasure-grounds, is another thing.  I am not fond of the idea of my\n",
      "shrubberies being always approachable; and I should recommend Miss\n",
      "Elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden.  I am very\n",
      "little disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary\n",
      "favour, I assure you, be he sailor or soldier.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After a short pause, Mr Shepherd presumed to say--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In all these cases, there are established usages which make everything\n",
      "plain and easy between landlord and tenant.  Your interest, Sir Walter,\n",
      "is in pretty safe hands.  Depend upon me for taking care that no tenant\n",
      "has more than his just rights.  I venture to hint, that Sir Walter\n",
      "Elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own, as John Shepherd will be\n",
      "for him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Anne spoke--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least an\n",
      "equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and all the\n",
      "privileges which any home can give.  Sailors work hard enough for their\n",
      "comforts, we must all allow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very true, very true.  What Miss Anne says, is very true,\" was Mr\n",
      "Shepherd's rejoinder, and \"Oh! certainly,\" was his daughter's; but Sir\n",
      "Walter's remark was, soon afterwards--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see any\n",
      "friend of mine belonging to it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed!\" was the reply, and with a look of surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds of\n",
      "objection to it.  First, as being the means of bringing persons of\n",
      "obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours which\n",
      "their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly, as it\n",
      "cuts up a man's youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old\n",
      "sooner than any other man.  I have observed it all my life.  A man is\n",
      "in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one\n",
      "whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to, and of\n",
      "becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in any other\n",
      "line.  One day last spring, in town, I was in company with two men,\n",
      "striking instances of what I am talking of; Lord St Ives, whose father\n",
      "we all know to have been a country curate, without bread to eat; I was\n",
      "to give place to Lord St Ives, and a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most\n",
      "deplorable-looking personage you can imagine; his face the colour of\n",
      "mahogany, rough and rugged to the last degree; all lines and wrinkles,\n",
      "nine grey hairs of a side, and nothing but a dab of powder at top.  'In\n",
      "the name of heaven, who is that old fellow?' said I to a friend of mine\n",
      "who was standing near, (Sir Basil Morley).  'Old fellow!' cried Sir\n",
      "Basil, 'it is Admiral Baldwin.  What do you take his age to be?'\n",
      "'Sixty,' said I, 'or perhaps sixty-two.' 'Forty,' replied Sir Basil,\n",
      "'forty, and no more.'  Picture to yourselves my amazement; I shall not\n",
      "easily forget Admiral Baldwin.  I never saw quite so wretched an\n",
      "example of what a sea-faring life can do; but to a degree, I know it is\n",
      "the same with them all:  they are all knocked about, and exposed to\n",
      "every climate, and every weather, till they are not fit to be seen.  It\n",
      "is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once, before they reach\n",
      "Admiral Baldwin's age.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, Sir Walter,\" cried Mrs Clay, \"this is being severe indeed.  Have\n",
      "a little mercy on the poor men.  We are not all born to be handsome.\n",
      "The sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes; I\n",
      "have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth.  But then, is not\n",
      "it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other?  Soldiers,\n",
      "in active service, are not at all better off:  and even in the quieter\n",
      "professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind, if not of the\n",
      "body, which seldom leaves a man's looks to the natural effect of time.\n",
      "The lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician is up at all hours,\n",
      "and travelling in all weather; and even the clergyman--\" she stopt a\n",
      "moment to consider what might do for the clergyman;--\"and even the\n",
      "clergyman, you know is obliged to go into infected rooms, and expose\n",
      "his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere.  In\n",
      "fact, as I have long been convinced, though every profession is\n",
      "necessary and honourable in its turn, it is only the lot of those who\n",
      "are not obliged to follow any, who can live in a regular way, in the\n",
      "country, choosing their own hours, following their own pursuits, and\n",
      "living on their own property, without the torment of trying for more;\n",
      "it is only their lot, I say, to hold the blessings of health and a good\n",
      "appearance to the utmost: I know no other set of men but what lose\n",
      "something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed as if Mr Shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak Sir Walter's\n",
      "good will towards a naval officer as tenant, had been gifted with\n",
      "foresight; for the very first application for the house was from an\n",
      "Admiral Croft, with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in\n",
      "attending the quarter sessions at Taunton; and indeed, he had received\n",
      "a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent.  By the report which\n",
      "he hastened over to Kellynch to make, Admiral Croft was a native of\n",
      "Somersetshire, who having acquired a very handsome fortune, was wishing\n",
      "to settle in his own country, and had come down to Taunton in order to\n",
      "look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood, which,\n",
      "however, had not suited him; that accidentally hearing--(it was just as\n",
      "he had foretold, Mr Shepherd observed, Sir Walter's concerns could not\n",
      "be kept a secret,)--accidentally hearing of the possibility of\n",
      "Kellynch Hall being to let, and understanding his (Mr Shepherd's)\n",
      "connection with the owner, he had introduced himself to him in order to\n",
      "make particular inquiries, and had, in the course of a pretty long\n",
      "conference, expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man\n",
      "who knew it only by description could feel; and given Mr Shepherd, in\n",
      "his explicit account of himself, every proof of his being a most\n",
      "responsible, eligible tenant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And who is Admiral Croft?\" was Sir Walter's cold suspicious inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman's family, and\n",
      "mentioned a place; and Anne, after the little pause which followed,\n",
      "added--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is a rear admiral of the white.  He was in the Trafalgar action,\n",
      "and has been in the East Indies since; he was stationed there, I\n",
      "believe, several years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I take it for granted,\" observed Sir Walter, \"that his face is\n",
      "about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him, that Admiral Croft was a very hale,\n",
      "hearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure, but not\n",
      "much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour; not\n",
      "likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted a\n",
      "comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible; knew he must\n",
      "pay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished house of that\n",
      "consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised if Sir Walter\n",
      "had asked more; had inquired about the manor; would be glad of the\n",
      "deputation, certainly, but made no great point of it; said he sometimes\n",
      "took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all the\n",
      "circumstances of the Admiral's family, which made him peculiarly\n",
      "desirable as a tenant.  He was a married man, and without children; the\n",
      "very state to be wished for.  A house was never taken good care of, Mr\n",
      "Shepherd observed, without a lady: he did not know, whether furniture\n",
      "might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady, as\n",
      "where there were many children.  A lady, without a family, was the very\n",
      "best preserver of furniture in the world.  He had seen Mrs Croft, too;\n",
      "she was at Taunton with the admiral, and had been present almost all\n",

      "have been.  Anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger, that\n",
      "she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her\n",
      "sister.  She had little hope of success; but Elizabeth, who in the\n",
      "event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than\n",
      "herself, should never, she thought, have reason to reproach her for\n",
      "giving no warning.\n",
      "\n",
      "She spoke, and seemed only to offend.  Elizabeth could not conceive how\n",
      "such an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly answered\n",
      "for each party's perfectly knowing their situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs Clay,\" said she, warmly, \"never forgets who she is; and as I am\n",
      "rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be, I can\n",
      "assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly\n",
      "nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more\n",
      "strongly than most people.  And as to my father, I really should not\n",
      "have thought that he, who has kept himself single so long for our\n",
      "sakes, need be suspected now.  If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman,\n",
      "I grant you, it might be wrong to have her so much with me; not that\n",
      "anything in the world, I am sure, would induce my father to make a\n",
      "degrading match, but he might be rendered unhappy.  But poor Mrs Clay\n",
      "who, with all her merits, can never have been reckoned tolerably\n",
      "pretty, I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect\n",
      "safety.  One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her\n",
      "personal misfortunes, though I know you must fifty times.  That tooth\n",
      "of her's and those freckles.  Freckles do not disgust me so very much\n",
      "as they do him.  I have known a face not materially disfigured by a\n",
      "few, but he abominates them.  You must have heard him notice Mrs Clay's\n",
      "freckles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is hardly any personal defect,\" replied Anne, \"which an\n",
      "agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think very differently,\" answered Elizabeth, shortly; \"an agreeable\n",
      "manner may set off handsome features, but can never alter plain ones.\n",
      "However, at any rate, as I have a great deal more at stake on this\n",
      "point than anybody else can have, I think it rather unnecessary in you\n",
      "to be advising me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless of\n",
      "doing good.  Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion, might yet be\n",
      "made observant by it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sir Walter,\n",
      "Miss Elliot, and Mrs Clay to Bath. The party drove off in very good\n",
      "spirits; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the\n",
      "afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show\n",
      "themselves, and Anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate\n",
      "tranquillity, to the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her friend was not in better spirits than herself. Lady Russell felt\n",
      "this break-up of the family exceedingly.  Their respectability was as\n",
      "dear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become precious by\n",
      "habit.  It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds, and still\n",
      "worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into; and to escape\n",
      "the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village, and be out\n",
      "of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived, she had determined\n",
      "to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up Anne.\n",
      "Accordingly their removal was made together, and Anne was set down at\n",
      "Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage of Lady Russell's journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Uppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back had\n",
      "been completely in the old English style, containing only two houses\n",
      "superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers; the\n",
      "mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees,\n",
      "substantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage,\n",
      "enclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree trained\n",
      "round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young 'squire, it had\n",
      "received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage, for\n",
      "his residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda, French\n",
      "windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch the\n",
      "traveller's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and\n",
      "premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Anne had often been staying. She knew the ways of Uppercross as\n",
      "well as those of Kellynch. The two families were so continually\n",
      "meeting, so much in the habit of running in and out of each other's\n",
      "house at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary\n",
      "alone; but being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost\n",
      "a matter of course. Though better endowed than the elder sister, Mary\n",
      "had not Anne's understanding nor temper. While well, and happy, and\n",
      "properly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits;\n",
      "but any indisposition sunk her completely. She had no resources for\n",
      "solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot\n",
      "self-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress that of\n",
      "fancying herself neglected and ill-used. In person, she was inferior to\n",
      "both sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached the dignity of\n",
      "being \"a fine girl.\" She was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty\n",
      "little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which had been\n",
      "gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers and two\n",
      "children; and, on Anne's appearing, greeted her with--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So, you are come at last!  I began to think I should never see you.  I\n",
      "am so ill I can hardly speak.  I have not seen a creature the whole\n",
      "morning!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry to find you unwell,\" replied Anne.  \"You sent me such a\n",
      "good account of yourself on Thursday!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I made the best of it; I always do:  but I was very far from well\n",
      "at the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have\n",
      "been all this morning:  very unfit to be left alone, I am sure.\n",
      "Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way, and not\n",
      "able to ring the bell!  So, Lady Russell would not get out.  I do not\n",
      "think she has been in this house three times this summer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne said what was proper, and enquired after her husband.  \"Oh!\n",
      "Charles is out shooting.  I have not seen him since seven o'clock.  He\n",
      "would go, though I told him how ill I was.  He said he should not stay\n",
      "out long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one.  I\n",
      "assure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have had your little boys with you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable\n",
      "that they do me more harm than good.  Little Charles does not mind a\n",
      "word I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you will soon be better now,\" replied Anne, cheerfully.  \"You\n",
      "know I always cure you when I come.  How are your neighbours at the\n",
      "Great House?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can give you no account of them.  I have not seen one of them\n",
      "to-day, except Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the\n",
      "window, but without getting off his horse; and though I told him how\n",
      "ill I was, not one of them have been near me.  It did not happen to\n",
      "suit the Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never put themselves out\n",
      "of their way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone.  It is\n",
      "early.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never want them, I assure you.  They talk and laugh a great deal too\n",
      "much for me.  Oh! Anne, I am so very unwell!  It was quite unkind of\n",
      "you not to come on Thursday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of\n",
      "yourself!  You wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were\n",
      "perfectly well, and in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you\n",
      "must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the\n",
      "last: and besides what I felt on her account, I have really been so\n",
      "busy, have had so much to do, that I could not very conveniently have\n",
      "left Kellynch sooner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear me! what can you possibly have to do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A great many things, I assure you.  More than I can recollect in a\n",
      "moment; but I can tell you some.  I have been making a duplicate of the\n",
      "catalogue of my father's books and pictures.  I have been several times\n",
      "in the garden with Mackenzie, trying to understand, and make him\n",
      "understand, which of Elizabeth's plants are for Lady Russell.  I have\n",
      "had all my own little concerns to arrange, books and music to divide,\n",
      "and all my trunks to repack, from not having understood in time what\n",
      "was intended as to the waggons: and one thing I have had to do, Mary,\n",
      "of a more trying nature: going to almost every house in the parish, as\n",
      "a sort of take-leave.  I was told that they wished it.  But all these\n",
      "things took up a great deal of time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! well!\" and after a moment's pause, \"but you have never asked me\n",
      "one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you go then?  I have made no enquiries, because I concluded you\n",
      "must have been obliged to give up the party.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh yes! I went.  I was very well yesterday; nothing at all the matter\n",
      "with me till this morning.  It would have been strange if I had not\n",
      "gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope you had a pleasant\n",
      "party.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing remarkable.  One always knows beforehand what the dinner will\n",
      "be, and who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a\n",
      "carriage of one's own.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me, and we were so\n",
      "crowded!  They are both so very large, and take up so much room; and Mr\n",
      "Musgrove always sits forward.  So, there was I, crowded into the back\n",
      "seat with Henrietta and Louisa; and I think it very likely that my\n",
      "illness to-day may be owing to it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on\n",
      "Anne's side produced nearly a cure on Mary's.  She could soon sit\n",
      "upright on the sofa, and began to hope she might be able to leave it by\n",
      "dinner-time.  Then, forgetting to think of it, she was at the other end\n",
      "of the room, beautifying a nosegay; then, she ate her cold meat; and\n",
      "then she was well enough to propose a little walk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where shall we go?\" said she, when they were ready.  \"I suppose you\n",
      "will not like to call at the Great House before they have been to see\n",
      "you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have not the smallest objection on that account,\" replied Anne.  \"I\n",
      "should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know so\n",
      "well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible.  They ought\n",
      "to feel what is due to you as my sister.  However, we may as well go\n",
      "and sit with them a little  while, and when we have that over, we can\n",
      "enjoy our walk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent;\n",
      "but she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that,\n",
      "though there were on each side continual subjects of offence, neither\n",
      "family could now do without it.  To the Great House accordingly they\n",
      "went, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour,\n",
      "with a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present daughters\n",
      "of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a\n",
      "grand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables placed in\n",
      "every direction.  Oh! could the originals of the portraits against the\n",
      "wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue\n",
      "satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious of such an\n",
      "overthrow of all order and neatness!  The portraits themselves seemed\n",
      "to be staring in astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration,\n",
      "perhaps of improvement.  The father and mother were in the old English\n",
      "style, and the young people in the new.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove were a\n",
      "very good sort of people; friendly and hospitable, not much educated,\n",
      "and not at all elegant.  Their children had more modern minds and\n",
      "manners.  There was a numerous family; but the only two grown up,\n",
      "excepting Charles, were Henrietta and Louisa, young ladies of nineteen\n",
      "and twenty, who had brought from school at Exeter all the usual stock\n",
      "of accomplishments, and were now like thousands of other young ladies,\n",
      "living to be fashionable, happy, and merry.  Their dress had every\n",
      "advantage, their faces were rather pretty, their spirits extremely\n",
      "good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant; they were of consequence\n",
      "at home, and favourites abroad.  Anne always contemplated them as some\n",
      "of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance; but still, saved as we\n",
      "all are, by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for\n",
      "the possibility of exchange, she would not have given up her own more\n",
      "elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them\n",
      "nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement\n",
      "together, that good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known\n",
      "so little herself with either of her sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were received with great cordiality.  Nothing seemed amiss on the\n",
      "side of the Great House family, which was generally, as Anne very well\n",
      "knew, the least to blame.  The half hour was chatted away pleasantly\n",
      "enough; and she was not at all surprised, at the end of it, to have\n",
      "their walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves, at Mary's\n",
      "particular invitation.\n",

      "miles, will often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and\n",

      "that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of\n",

      "brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well, and\n",

      "consequence to his character, and more usefulness, rationality, and\n",
      "elegance to his habits and pursuits.  As it was, he did nothing with\n",
      "much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise trifled away, without\n",
      "benefit from books or anything else.  He had very good spirits, which\n",

      "\n",
      "She had this communication, moreover, from Mary.  \"Mrs Musgrove thinks\n",
      "all her servants so steady, that it would be high treason to call it in\n",
      "question; but I am sure, without exaggeration, that her upper\n",
      "house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being in their business, are\n",
      "gadding about the village, all day long.  I meet them wherever I go;\n",
      "and I declare, I never go twice into my nursery without seeing\n",
      "something of them.  If Jemima were not the trustiest, steadiest\n",
      "creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her; for she tells\n",
      "me, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them.\" And on Mrs\n",
      "Musgrove's side, it was, \"I make a rule of never interfering in any of\n",
      "my daughter-in-law's concerns, for I know it would not do; but I shall\n",
      "tell you, Miss Anne, because you may be able to set things to rights,\n",
      "that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles's nursery-maid: I hear\n",
      "strange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from my own\n",
      "knowledge, I can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady, that she is\n",
      "enough to ruin any servants she comes near.  Mrs Charles quite swears\n",
      "by her, I know; but I just give you this hint, that you may be upon the\n",
      "watch; because, if you see anything amiss, you need not be afraid of\n",
      "mentioning it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, it was Mary's complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to\n",
      "give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined at the Great\n",
      "House with other families; and she did not see any reason why she was\n",
      "to be considered so much at home as to lose her place.  And one day\n",
      "when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them after\n",
      "talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said, \"I have no\n",
      "scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are about\n",
      "their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you\n",
      "are about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would\n",
      "be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious, especially if\n",
      "she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma.\n",
      "Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma, but it would be\n",
      "more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.  It is not that\n",
      "mamma cares about it the least in the world, but I know it is taken\n",
      "notice of by many persons.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "How was Anne to set all these matters to rights?  She could do little\n",
      "more than listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each to\n",
      "the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between\n",
      "such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest which were meant\n",
      "for her sister's benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.  Her\n",
      "own spirits improved by change of place and subject, by being removed\n",
      "three miles from Kellynch; Mary's ailments lessened by having a\n",
      "constant companion, and their daily intercourse with the other family,\n",
      "since there was neither superior affection, confidence, nor employment\n",
      "in the cottage, to be interrupted by it, was rather an advantage.  It\n",
      "was certainly carried nearly as far as possible, for they met every\n",
      "morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder; but she believed\n",
      "they should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and Mrs\n",
      "Musgrove's respectable forms in the usual places, or without the\n",
      "talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves, but\n",
      "having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents, to sit\n",
      "by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was little thought\n",
      "of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others, as she was well\n",
      "aware.  She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to\n",
      "herself; but this was no new sensation.  Excepting one short period of\n",
      "her life, she had never, since the age of fourteen, never since the\n",
      "loss of her dear mother, known the happiness of being listened to, or\n",
      "encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste.  In music she had\n",
      "been always used to feel alone in the world; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove's\n",
      "fond partiality for their own daughters' performance, and total\n",
      "indifference to any other person's, gave her much more pleasure for\n",
      "their sakes, than mortification for her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company.\n",
      "The neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited by\n",
      "everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers, more visitors\n",
      "by invitation and by chance, than any other family.  They were more\n",
      "completely popular.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally,\n",
      "in an unpremeditated little ball.  There was a family of cousins within\n",
      "a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances, who depended on\n",
      "the Musgroves for all their pleasures:  they would come at any time,\n",
      "and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne, very much\n",
      "preferring the office of musician to a more active post, played country\n",
      "dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which always\n",
      "recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove\n",
      "more than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--\"Well done,\n",
      "Miss Anne! very well done indeed!  Lord bless me!  how those little\n",
      "fingers of yours fly about!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So passed the first three weeks.  Michaelmas came; and now Anne's heart\n",
      "must be in Kellynch again.  A beloved home made over to others; all the\n",
      "precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects, beginning to own\n",
      "other eyes and other limbs!  She could not think of much else on the\n",
      "29th of September; and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening\n",
      "from Mary, who, on having occasion to note down the day of the month,\n",
      "exclaimed, \"Dear me, is not this the day the Crofts were to come to\n",
      "Kellynch?  I am glad I did not think of it before.  How low it makes\n",
      "me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were to be\n",
      "visited.  Mary deplored the necessity for herself.  \"Nobody knew how\n",
      "much she should suffer.  She should put it off as long as she could;\"\n",
      "but was not easy till she had talked Charles into driving her over on\n",
      "an early day, and was in a very animated, comfortable state of\n",
      "imaginary agitation, when she came back.  Anne had very sincerely\n",
      "rejoiced in there being no means of her going.  She wished, however to\n",
      "see the Crofts, and was glad to be within when the visit was returned.\n",
      "They came:  the master of the house was not at home, but the two\n",
      "sisters were together; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the\n",
      "share of Anne, while the Admiral sat by Mary, and made himself very\n",
      "agreeable by his good-humoured notice of her little boys, she was well\n",
      "able to watch for a likeness, and if it failed her in the features, to\n",
      "catch it in the voice, or in the turn of sentiment and expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness, uprightness,\n",
      "and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.  She had\n",
      "bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face; though\n",
      "her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence of her\n",
      "having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to have\n",
      "lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.\n",
      "Her manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had no distrust\n",
      "of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any approach to\n",
      "coarseness, however, or any want of good humour.  Anne gave her credit,\n",
      "indeed, for feelings of great consideration towards herself, in all\n",
      "that related to Kellynch, and it pleased her: especially, as she had\n",
      "satisfied herself in the very first half minute, in the instant even of\n",
      "introduction, that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge\n",
      "or suspicion on Mrs Croft's side, to give a bias of any sort.  She was\n",
      "quite easy on that head, and consequently full of strength and courage,\n",
      "till for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft's suddenly saying,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had the\n",
      "pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion\n",
      "she certainly had not.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?\" added Mrs Croft.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel, when Mrs\n",
      "Croft's next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth of whom she spoke,\n",
      "that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother. She\n",
      "immediately felt how reasonable it was, that Mrs Croft should be\n",
      "thinking and speaking of Edward, and not of Frederick; and with shame\n",
      "at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their\n",
      "former neighbour's present state with proper interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving, she\n",
      "heard the Admiral say to Mary--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft's here soon; I dare say you\n",
      "know him by name.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys, clinging to\n",
      "him like an old friend, and declaring he should not go; and being too\n",
      "much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets,\n",
      "&c., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had\n",
      "begun, Anne was left to persuade herself, as well as she could, that\n",
      "the same brother must still be in question.  She could not, however,\n",
      "reach such a degree of certainty, as not to be anxious to hear whether\n",
      "anything had been said on the subject at the other house, where the\n",
      "Crofts had previously been calling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at\n",
      "the Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to\n",
      "be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for, when the\n",
      "youngest Miss Musgrove walked in.  That she was coming to apologize,\n",
      "and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves, was the\n",
      "first black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted, when Louisa\n",
      "made all right by saying, that she only came on foot, to leave more\n",
      "room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I will tell you our reason,\" she added, \"and all about it.  I am\n",
      "come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are out of spirits this\n",
      "evening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much of poor Richard!\n",
      "And we agreed it would be best to have the harp, for it seems to amuse\n",
      "her more than the piano-forte.  I will tell you why she is out of\n",
      "spirits.  When the Crofts called this morning, (they called here\n",
      "afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say, that her brother,\n",
      "Captain Wentworth, is just returned to England, or paid off, or\n",
      "something, and is coming to see them almost directly; and most\n",
      "unluckily it came into mamma's head, when they were gone, that\n",
      "Wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of poor Richard's\n",
      "captain at one time; I do not know when or where, but a great while\n",
      "before he died, poor fellow!  And upon looking over his letters and\n",
      "things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure that this must be\n",
      "the very man, and her head is quite full of it, and of poor Richard!\n",
      "So we must be as merry as we can, that she may not be dwelling upon\n",
      "such gloomy things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were,\n",
      "that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome,\n",
      "hopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his\n",
      "twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and\n",
      "unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for at any\n",
      "time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved; seldom heard\n",
      "of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence of his death\n",
      "abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for\n",
      "him, by calling him \"poor Richard,\" been nothing better than a\n",
      "thick-headed, unfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done\n",
      "anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name,\n",
      "living or dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those\n",
      "removals to which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such\n",
      "midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on\n",
      "board Captain Frederick Wentworth's frigate, the Laconia; and from the\n",
      "Laconia he had, under the influence of his captain, written the only\n",
      "two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him\n",
      "during the whole of his absence; that is to say, the only two\n",
      "disinterested letters; all the rest had been mere applications for\n",
      "money.\n",

      "In each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet, so little\n",
      "were they in the habit of attending to such matters, so unobservant and\n",
      "incurious were they as to the names of men or ships, that it had made\n",
      "scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove should have\n",
      "been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection of the name of\n",
      "Wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those extraordinary\n",
      "bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed; and the\n",
      "re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval, her poor son\n",
      "gone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten, had\n",
      "affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into greater grief for\n",
      "him than she had known on first hearing of his death.  Mr Musgrove was,\n",
      "in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when they reached the\n",
      "cottage, they were evidently in want, first, of being listened to anew\n",
      "on this subject, and afterwards, of all the relief which cheerful\n",
      "companions could give them.\n",
      "\n",
      "To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his name\n",
      "so often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it\n",

      "coming back from Clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say\n",
      "whether it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to\n",

      "how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma's\n",

      "Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all.  You\n",

      "disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it, and Charles\n",
      "is as bad as any of them.  Very unfeeling!  I must say it is very\n",
      "unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy.  Talks of\n",
      "his being going on so well!  How does he know that he is going on well,\n",
      "or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence?  I did not\n",
      "think Charles would have been so unfeeling.  So here he is to go away\n",

      "allowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit than anybody else\n",
      "to be about the child.  My being the mother is the very reason why my\n",
      "feelings should not be tried.  I am not at all equal to it.  You saw\n",
      "how hysterical I was yesterday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--of the\n",
      "shock.  You will not be hysterical again.  I dare say we shall have\n",
      "nothing to distress us.  I perfectly understand Mr Robinson's\n",
      "directions, and have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder at\n",
      "your husband.  Nursing does not belong to a man; it is not his\n",

      "dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself,\n",

      "You, who have not a mother's feelings, are a great deal the properest\n",

      "Jemima.  Oh! I shall certainly go; I am sure I ought if I can, quite as\n",
      "much as Charles, for they want me excessively to be acquainted with\n",
      "Captain Wentworth, and I know you do not mind being left alone.  An\n",

      "quite at ease about my dear child.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "stay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him.  It is\n",
      "Anne's own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be a great\n",

      "to dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening,\n",
      "when the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her to\n",

      "together in high spirits.  They were gone, she hoped, to be happy,\n",
      "however oddly constructed such happiness might seem; as for herself,\n",
      "she was left with as many sensations of comfort, as were, perhaps, ever\n",
      "likely to be hers.  She knew herself to be of the first utility to the\n",

      "again, he need not have waited till this time; he would have done what\n",

      "Wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all to know each other\n",
      "perfectly, and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with\n",
      "Charles.  He was to come to breakfast, but not at the Cottage, though\n",
      "that had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed to come\n",
      "to the Great House instead, and he seemed afraid of being in Mrs\n",

      "\n",
      "Anne understood it.  He wished to avoid seeing her.  He had inquired\n",

      "actuated, perhaps, by the same view of escaping introduction when they\n",
      "were to meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the\n",

      "say that they were just setting off, that he was come for his dogs,\n",
      "that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth; his sisters\n",
      "meaning to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth proposing\n",
      "also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient; and though\n",
      "Charles had answered for the child's being in no such state as could\n",
      "make it inconvenient, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without\n",
      "his running on to give notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive\n",
      "him, while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne, of which this was the\n",
      "most consoling, that it would soon be over.  And it was soon over.  In\n",
      "two minutes after Charles's preparation, the others appeared; they were\n",
      "in the drawing-room.  Her eye half met Captain Wentworth's, a bow, a\n",
      "curtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to Mary, said all that\n",
      "was right, said something to the Miss Musgroves, enough to mark an easy\n",
      "footing; the room seemed full, full of persons and voices, but a few\n",
      "minutes ended it.  Charles shewed himself at the window, all was ready,\n",
      "their visitor had bowed and was gone, the Miss Musgroves were gone too,\n",
      "suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the\n",
      "sportsmen:  the room was cleared, and Anne might finish her breakfast\n",
      "as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is over! it is over!\" she repeated to herself again and again, in\n",
      "nervous gratitude.  \"The worst is over!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary talked, but she could not attend.  She had seen him.  They had\n",

      "\n",
      "Soon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling\n",
      "less.  Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been\n",
      "given up.  How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an\n",
      "interval had banished into distance and indistinctness!  What might not\n",
      "eight years do?  Events of every description, changes, alienations,\n",
      "removals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past--\n",
      "how natural, how certain too!  It included nearly a third part of her\n",
      "own life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas! with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings\n",
      "eight years may be little more than nothing.\n",

      "Now, how were his sentiments to be read?  Was this like wishing to\n",

      "\n",
      "On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have\n",
      "prevented, she was soon spared all suspense; for, after the Miss\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne, though he was so\n",

      "\"Altered beyond his knowledge.\"  Anne fully submitted, in silent, deep\n",

      "which could not but dwell with her.  Yet she soon began to rejoice that\n",

      "agitation; they composed, and consequently must make her happier.\n",
      "\n",

      "without an idea that they would be carried round to her.  He had\n",

      "spoken as he felt.  He had not forgiven Anne Elliot.  She had used him\n",
      "ill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse, she had shewn a\n",
      "feebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided, confident\n",
      "temper could not endure.  She had given him up to oblige others.  It\n",

      "timidity.\n",

      "in the Sound, when a gale came on, which lasted four days and nights,\n",
      "and which would have done for poor old Asp in half the time; our touch\n",
      "with the Great Nation not having much improved our condition.\n",
      "Four-and-twenty hours later, and I should only have been a gallant\n",

      "always forgot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know.  Dick had been left ill at\n",
      "Gibraltar, with a recommendation from his former captain to Captain\n",

      "hear him talked of by such a good friend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case,\n",
      "only nodded in reply, and walked away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls were now hunting for the Laconia; and Captain Wentworth could\n",
      "not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his\n",
      "own hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud the little\n",
      "statement of her name and rate, and present non-commissioned class,\n",
      "observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man\n",
      "ever had.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia!  How fast I made\n",

      "off the Western Islands.  Poor Harville, sister!  You know how much he\n",
      "wanted money:  worse than myself.  He had a wife.  Excellent fellow.  I\n",
      "shall never forget his happiness.  He felt it all, so much for her\n",
      "sake.  I wished for him again the next summer, when I had still the\n",
      "same luck in the Mediterranean.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I am sure, Sir,\" said Mrs Musgrove, \"it was a lucky day for us,\n",

      "you did.\"\n",

      "you, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth's face at this\n",
      "speech, a certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome\n",
      "mouth, which convinced Anne, that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove's\n",
      "kind wishes, as to her son, he had probably been at some pains to get\n",
      "rid of him; but it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to\n",

      "moment he was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly\n",
      "afterwards coming up to the sofa, on which she and Mrs Musgrove were\n",
      "sitting, took a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with\n",
      "her, in a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy and\n",

      "real and unabsurd in the parent's feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had most readily\n",
      "made room for him; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove.  It was no\n",
      "insignificant barrier, indeed.  Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable,\n",
      "substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature to express good\n",
      "cheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment; and while the\n",
      "agitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face, may be considered\n",
      "as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth should be allowed some\n",
      "credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat\n",
      "sighings over the destiny of a son, whom alive nobody had cared for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary\n",
      "proportions.  A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep\n",
      "affliction, as the most graceful set of limbs in the world.  But, fair\n",
      "or not fair, there are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will\n",
      "patronize in vain--which taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will\n",
      "seize.\n",

      "The Admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room\n",
      "with his hands behind him, being called to order by his wife, now came\n",
      "up to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation of what he might\n",
      "be interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts, began with--\n",

      "hours might comprehend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, if I know myself,\" said he, \"this is from no want of gallantry\n",

      "one's efforts, and all one's sacrifices, to make the accommodations on\n",
      "board such as women ought to have.  There can be no want of gallantry,\n",
      "Admiral, in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high,\n",
      "and this is what I do.  I hate to hear of women on board, or to see\n",
      "them on board; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman, and as if\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Ah! my dear,\" said the Admiral, \"when he had got a wife, he will sing\n",

      "to Mrs Croft.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pretty well, ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage; though many\n",
      "women have done more.  I have crossed the Atlantic four times, and have\n",
      "been once to the East Indies, and back again, and only once; besides\n",
      "being in different places about home: Cork, and Lisbon, and Gibraltar.\n",
      "But I never went beyond the Streights, and never was in the West\n",
      "Indies.  We do not call Bermuda or Bahama, you know, the West Indies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse\n",
      "herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her\n",
      "life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I do assure you, ma'am,\" pursued Mrs Croft, \"that nothing can\n",
      "exceed the accommodations of a man-of-war; I speak, you know, of the\n",
      "higher rates.  When you come to a frigate, of course, you are more\n",
      "confined; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of\n",
      "them; and I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been\n",
      "spent on board a ship.  While we were together, you know, there was\n",
      "nothing to be feared.  Thank God!  I have always been blessed with\n",
      "excellent health, and no climate disagrees with me.  A little\n",
      "disordered always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but\n",
      "never knew what sickness was afterwards.  The only time I ever really\n",
      "suffered in body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myself\n",
      "unwell, or had any ideas of danger, was the winter that I passed by\n",
      "myself at Deal, when the Admiral (Captain Croft then) was in the North\n",
      "Seas.  I lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of\n",
      "imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself, or when I\n",
      "should hear from him next; but as long as we could be together, nothing\n",
      "ever ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, to be sure.  Yes, indeed, oh yes!  I am quite of your opinion,\n",
      "Mrs Croft,\" was Mrs Musgrove's hearty answer.  \"There is nothing so bad\n",
      "as a separation.  I am quite of your opinion.  I know what it is, for\n",

      "The evening ended with dancing.  On its being proposed, Anne offered\n",
      "her services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes fill with\n",
      "tears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad to be\n",
      "employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits than\n",
      "Captain Wentworth.  She felt that he had every thing to elevate him\n",
      "which general attention and deference, and especially the attention of\n",
      "all the young women, could do.  The Miss Hayters, the females of the\n",
      "family of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted to the\n",
      "honour of being in love with him; and as for Henrietta and Louisa, they\n",
      "both seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but the continued\n",
      "appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves could have\n",
      "made it credible that they were not decided rivals.  If he were a\n",
      "little spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration, who could\n",
      "wonder?\n",
      "\n",
      "These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne, while her fingers\n",
      "were mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together,\n",
      "equally without error, and without consciousness.  Once she felt that\n",
      "he was looking at herself,  observing her altered features, perhaps,\n",
      "trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed\n",
      "him; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her; she was hardly\n",
      "aware of it, till she heard the answer; but then she was sure of his\n",
      "having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced?  The answer\n",
      "was, \"Oh, no; never; she has quite given up dancing.  She had rather\n",
      "play.  She is never tired of playing.\"  Once, too, he spoke to her.\n",
      "She had left the instrument on the dancing being over, and he had sat\n",
      "down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the Miss\n",
      "Musgroves an idea of.  Unintentionally she returned to that part of the\n",
      "room; he saw her, and, instantly rising, said, with studied politeness--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;\" and though she\n",
      "immediately drew back with a decided negative, he was not to be induced\n",
      "to sit down again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches.  His cold\n",
      "politeness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything.\n",

      "he liked, being as thoroughly the object of the Admiral's fraternal\n",
      "kindness as of his wife's.  He had intended, on first arriving, to\n",
      "proceed very soon into Shropshire, and visit the brother settled in\n",
      "that country, but the attractions of Uppercross induced him to put this\n",
      "off.  There was so much of friendliness, and of flattery, and of\n",
      "everything most bewitching in his reception there; the old were so\n",
      "hospitable, the young so agreeable, that he could not but resolve to\n",

      "Croft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves in\n",
      "their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about\n",
      "in a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig,\n",

      "Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the\n",
      "Musgroves and their dependencies.  It was unvarying, warm admiration\n",
      "everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more than established,\n",
      "when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them, to be a good deal\n",
      "disturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way.\n",

      "pleasing young man, between whom and Henrietta there had been a\n",
      "considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth's\n",
      "introduction.  He was in orders; and having a curacy in the\n",
      "neighbourhood, where residence was not required, lived at his father's\n",
      "house, only two miles from Uppercross.  A short absence from home had\n",
      "left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period,\n",

      "and of seeing Captain Wentworth.\n",

      "Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters.  They had each had money, but\n",
      "their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of\n",
      "consequence.  Mr Hayter had some property of his own, but it was\n",
      "insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove's; and while the Musgroves were\n",
      "in the first class of society in the country, the young Hayters would,\n",
      "from their parents' inferior, retired, and unpolished way of living,\n",
      "and their own defective education, have been hardly in any class at\n",
      "all, but for their connexion with Uppercross, this eldest son of course\n",
      "excepted, who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was\n",
      "very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no\n",
      "pride on one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a\n",
      "consciousness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them\n",
      "pleased to improve their cousins.  Charles's attentions to Henrietta\n",
      "had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation.\n",

      "chance.  There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark\n",
      "about them in the Mansion-house; but it was different at the Cottage:\n",
      "the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder; and\n",
      "Captain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss\n",
      "Musgroves' company, and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared, when\n",
      "Anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister, as to\n",
      "which was the one liked best.  Charles gave it for Louisa, Mary for\n",
      "Henrietta, but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be\n",
      "extremely delightful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles \"had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what he\n",
      "had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that he had\n",
      "not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.  Here was a\n",
      "fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance of what might\n",
      "be done in any future war; and he was sure Captain Wentworth was as\n",
      "likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy.  Oh! it\n",
      "would be a capital match for either of his sisters.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word it would,\" replied Mary.  \"Dear me!  If he should rise to\n",

      "Wentworth' sounds very well.  That would be a noble thing, indeed, for\n",
      "Henrietta!  She would take place of me then, and Henrietta would not\n",
      "dislike that.  Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth!  It would be but a new\n",
      "creation, however, and I never think much of your new creations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred on the very\n",
      "account of Charles Hayter, whose pretensions she wished to see put an\n",
      "end to.  She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters, and thought\n",
      "it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between\n",
      "the families renewed--very sad for herself and her children.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know,\" said she, \"I cannot think him at all a fit match for\n",
      "Henrietta; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made,\n",
      "she has no right to throw herself away.  I do not think any young woman\n",
      "has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient\n",
      "to the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections to\n",
      "those who have not been used to them.  And, pray, who is Charles\n",

      "Musgrove of Uppercross.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her husband, however, would not agree with her here; for besides having\n",
      "a regard for his cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son, and he saw\n",
      "things as an eldest son himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now you are talking nonsense, Mary,\" was therefore his answer.  \"It\n",
      "would not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has a very fair\n",
      "chance, through the Spicers, of getting something from the Bishop in\n",
      "the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember, that he\n",
      "is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very pretty\n",
      "property.  The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and\n",
      "fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton, which is some of the best\n",
      "land in the country.  I grant you, that any of them but Charles would\n",
      "be a very shocking match for Henrietta, and indeed it could not be; he\n",
      "is the only one that could be possible; but he is a very good-natured,\n",
      "good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands, he\n",
      "will make a different sort of place of it, and live in a very different\n",
      "sort of way; and with that property, he will never be a contemptible\n",
      "man--good, freehold property.  No, no; Henrietta might do worse than\n",
      "marry Charles Hayter; and if she has him, and Louisa can get Captain\n",
      "Wentworth, I shall be very well satisfied.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Charles may say what he pleases,\" cried Mary to Anne, as soon as he\n",
      "was out of the room, \"but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry\n",
      "Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse for me; and\n",
      "therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon\n",
      "put him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt that he\n",
      "has.  She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday.  I wish\n",
      "you had been there to see her behaviour.  And as to Captain Wentworth's\n",
      "liking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense to say so; for he\n",
      "certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best.  But Charles is so\n",
      "positive!  I wish you had been with us yesterday, for then you might\n",
      "have decided between us; and I am sure you would have thought as I did,\n",
      "unless you had been determined to give it against me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A dinner at Mr Musgrove's had been the occasion when all these things\n",
      "should have been seen by Anne; but she had staid at home, under the\n",
      "mixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return of indisposition\n",
      "in little Charles.  She had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth;\n",
      "but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the\n",
      "advantages of a quiet evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to Captain Wentworth's views, she deemed it of more consequence that\n",
      "he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the\n",
      "happiness of either sister, or impeaching his own honour, than that he\n",
      "should prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta.  Either of\n",
      "them would, in all probability, make him an affectionate, good-humoured\n",
      "wife.  With regard to Charles Hayter, she had delicacy which must be\n",
      "pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman, and a\n",
      "heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned; but if\n",
      "Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings, the\n",
      "alteration could not be understood too soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his\n",
      "cousin's behaviour.  She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly\n",
      "estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope, and\n",
      "leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross:  but there\n",
      "was such a change as became very alarming, when such a man as Captain\n",
      "Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause.  He had been absent\n",
      "only two Sundays, and when they parted, had left her interested, even\n",
      "to the height of his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his\n",
      "present curacy, and obtaining that of Uppercross instead.  It had then\n",
      "seemed the object nearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who\n",
      "for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties\n",
      "of his office, but was now growing too infirm for many of them, should\n",
      "be quite fixed on engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as\n",
      "good as he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of\n",
      "it.  The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead of\n",
      "going six miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better\n",
      "curacy; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr\n",
      "Shirley's being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get\n",
      "through without most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to\n",
      "Louisa, but had been almost everything to Henrietta.  When he came\n",
      "back, alas!  the zeal of the business was gone by.  Louisa could not\n",
      "listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held\n",
      "with Dr Shirley: she was at a window, looking out for Captain\n",
      "Wentworth; and even Henrietta had at best only a divided attention to\n",
      "give, and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude\n",
      "of the negotiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I am very glad indeed:  but I always thought you would have it;\n",
      "I always thought you sure.  It did not appear to me that--in short, you\n",

      "\n",
      "One morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves, at which Anne\n",
      "had not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into the drawing-room at\n",
      "the Cottage, where were only herself and the little invalid Charles,\n",
      "who was lying on the sofa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot, deprived\n",
      "his manners of their usual composure:  he started, and could only say,\n",
      "\"I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here: Mrs Musgrove told me I\n",
      "should find them here,\" before he walked to the window to recollect\n",
      "himself, and feel how he ought to behave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are up stairs with my sister:  they will be down in a few\n",
      "moments, I dare say,\" had been Anne's reply, in all the confusion that\n",
      "was natural; and if the child had not called her to come and do\n",
      "something for him, she would have been out of the room the next moment,\n",
      "and released Captain Wentworth as well as herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying, \"I\n",
      "hope the little boy is better,\" was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there to satisfy\n",
      "her patient; and thus they continued a few minutes, when, to her very\n",
      "great satisfaction, she heard some other person crossing the little\n",
      "vestibule.  She hoped, on turning her head, to see the master of the\n",
      "house; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters\n",
      "easy--Charles Hayter, probably not at all better pleased by the sight\n",
      "of Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of\n",
      "Anne.\n",
      "\n",
      "She only attempted to say, \"How do you do?  Will you not sit down?  The\n",
      "others will be here presently.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently not\n",
      "ill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end to\n",
      "his attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up the\n",
      "newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another minute brought another addition.  The younger boy, a remarkable\n",
      "stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door opened for\n",
      "him by some one without, made his determined appearance among them, and\n",
      "went straight to the sofa to see what was going on, and put in his\n",
      "claim to anything good that might be giving away.\n",
      "\n",
      "There being nothing to eat, he could only have some play; and as his\n",
      "aunt would not let him tease his sick brother, he began to fasten\n",
      "himself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that, busy as she was\n",
      "about Charles, she could not shake him off.  She spoke to him, ordered,\n",
      "entreated, and insisted in vain.  Once she did contrive to push him\n",
      "away, but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back\n",
      "again directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Walter,\" said she, \"get down this moment.  You are extremely\n",
      "troublesome.  I am very angry with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Walter,\" cried Charles Hayter, \"why do you not do as you are bid?  Do\n",
      "not you hear your aunt speak?  Come to me, Walter, come to cousin\n",
      "Charles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But not a bit did Walter stir.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another moment, however, she found herself in the state of being\n",
      "released from him; some one was taking him from her, though he had bent\n",
      "down her head so much, that his little sturdy hands were unfastened\n",
      "from around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away, before she knew\n",
      "that Captain Wentworth had done it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless.  She\n",
      "could not even thank him.  She could only hang over little Charles,\n",
      "with most disordered feelings.  His kindness in stepping forward to her\n",
      "relief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed, the little\n",
      "particulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon forced on her\n",
      "by the noise he was studiously making with the child, that he meant to\n",
      "avoid hearing her thanks, and rather sought to testify that her\n",
      "conversation was the last of his wants, produced such a confusion of\n",
      "varying, but very painful agitation, as she could not recover from,\n",
      "till enabled by the entrance of Mary and the Miss Musgroves to make\n",
      "over her little patient to their cares, and leave the room.  She could\n",
      "not stay.  It might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and\n",
      "jealousies of the four--they were now altogether; but she could stay\n",
      "for none of it.  It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well\n",
      "inclined towards Captain Wentworth.  She had a strong impression of his\n",
      "having said, in a vext tone of voice, after Captain Wentworth's\n",
      "interference, \"You ought to have minded me, Walter; I told you not to\n",
      "teaze your aunt;\" and could comprehend his regretting that Captain\n",
      "Wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself.  But neither\n",
      "Charles Hayter's feelings, nor anybody's feelings, could interest her,\n",
      "till she had a little better arranged her own.  She was ashamed of\n",
      "herself, quite ashamed of being so nervous, so overcome by such a\n",
      "trifle; but so it was, and it required a long application of solitude\n",
      "and reflection to recover her.\n",

      "jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, \"Oh, yes, I should like\n",
      "to join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;\" Anne felt\n",
      "persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely what\n",
      "they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity which the\n",
      "family habits seemed to produce, of everything being to be\n",
      "communicated, and everything being to be done together, however\n",
      "undesired and inconvenient.  She tried to dissuade Mary from going, but\n",
      "in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept the Miss\n",
      "Musgroves' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise, as\n",
      "she might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening the\n",
      "interference in any plan of their own.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long\n",

      "Their time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready\n",
      "for this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure.  Could Anne have\n",
      "foreseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but, from some\n",
      "feelings of interest and curiosity, she fancied now that it was too\n",
      "late to retract, and the whole six set forward together in the\n",
      "direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves, who evidently considered the\n",
      "walk as under their guidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne's object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where the\n",
      "narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary, to keep\n",

      "the exercise and the day, from the view of the last smiles of the year\n",
      "upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges, and from repeating to\n",
      "herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of\n",
      "autumn, that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind\n",
      "of taste and tenderness, that season which had drawn from every poet,\n",
      "worthy of being read, some attempt at description, or some lines of\n",
      "feeling.  She occupied her mind as much as possible in such like\n",
      "musings and quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach\n",
      "of Captain Wentworth's conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves,\n",
      "she should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable.\n",
      "It was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate\n",
      "footing, might fall into.  He was more engaged with Louisa than with\n",
      "Henrietta.  Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her\n",

      "speech of Louisa's which struck her.  After one of the many praises of\n",
      "the day, which were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworth\n",
      "added:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister!  They meant to\n",
      "take a long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from some of\n",
      "these hills.  They talked of coming into this side of the country.  I\n",
      "wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day.  Oh! it does happen very\n",
      "often, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it; she would as\n",
      "lieve be tossed out as not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! You make the most of it, I know,\" cried Louisa, \"but if it were\n",
      "really so, I should do just the same in her place.  If I loved a man,\n",
      "as she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing should\n",
      "ever separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven\n",
      "safely by anybody else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was spoken with enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Had you?\" cried he, catching the same tone; \"I honour you!\" And there\n",
      "was silence between them for a little while.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again.  The sweet\n",

      "fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining\n",
      "happiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone\n",
      "together, blessed her memory.  She roused herself to say, as they\n",

      "wished; but \"No!\" said Charles Musgrove, and \"No, no!\" cried Louisa\n",

      "Charles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution\n",
      "of calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently,\n",
      "though more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too.  But this\n",
      "was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength; and when\n",
      "he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at\n",

      "After a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations,\n",
      "it was settled between Charles and his two sisters, that he and\n",
      "Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt and\n",
      "cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the\n",
      "hill.  Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan; and, as she\n",

      "degrees quite out of sight and sound, Mary was happy no longer; she\n",
      "quarrelled with her own seat, was sure Louisa had got a much better\n",

      "better also.  She turned through the same gate, but could not see them.\n",

      "making their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the\n",
      "centre.  They were speaking as they drew near.  Louisa's voice was the\n",
      "first distinguished.  She seemed to be in the middle of some eager\n",
      "speech.  What Anne first heard was--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so, I made her go.  I could not bear that she should be frightened\n",
      "from the visit by such nonsense.  What! would I be turned back from\n",
      "doing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right,\n",
      "by the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may\n",
      "say?  No, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded.  When I have\n",
      "made up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have\n",

      "\n",
      "\"She would have turned back then, but for you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She would indeed.  I am almost ashamed to say it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand!  After the hints\n",
      "you gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations, the last\n",
      "time I was in company with him,  I need not affect to have no\n",
      "comprehension of what is going on.  I see that more than a mere dutiful\n",
      "morning visit to your aunt was in question; and woe betide him, and her\n",
      "too, when it comes to things of consequence, when they are placed in\n",

      "resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this.\n",
      "Your sister is an amiable creature; but yours is the character of\n",

      "doubt, you have been always doing.  It is the worst evil of too\n",
      "yielding and indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be\n",
      "depended on.  You are never sure of a good impression being durable;\n",

      "a beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength, has\n",
      "outlived all the storms of autumn.  Not a puncture, not a weak spot\n",
      "anywhere.  This nut,\" he continued, with playful solemnity, \"while so\n",
      "many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot, is still\n",
      "in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed\n",
      "capable of.\"  Then returning to his former earnest tone--\"My first\n",
      "wish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should be firm.  If\n",
      "Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life,\n",

      "He had done, and was unanswered.  It would have surprised Anne if\n",
      "Louisa could have readily answered such a speech:  words of such\n",
      "interest, spoken with such serious warmth!  She could imagine what\n",
      "Louisa was feeling.  For herself, she feared to move, lest she should\n",
      "be seen.  While she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected\n",
      "her, and they were moving on.  Before they were beyond her hearing,\n",
      "however, Louisa spoke again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mary is good-natured enough in many respects,\" said she; \"but she does\n",
      "sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense and pride--the Elliot\n",
      "pride.  She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride.  We do so\n",
      "wish that Charles had married Anne instead.  I suppose you know he\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I do not exactly know, for Henrietta and I were at school at the time;\n",
      "but I believe about a year before he married Mary.  I wish she had\n",
      "accepted him.  We should all have liked her a great deal better; and\n",
      "papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell's\n",
      "doing, that she did not.  They think Charles might not be learned and\n",
      "bookish enough to please Lady Russell, and that therefore, she\n",
      "persuaded Anne to refuse him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more.  Her own\n",
      "emotions still kept her fixed.  She had much to recover from, before\n",
      "she could move.  The listener's proverbial fate was not absolutely\n",
      "hers; she had heard no evil of herself, but she had heard a great deal\n",
      "of very painful import.  She saw how her own character was considered\n",
      "by Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree of feeling\n",
      "and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme\n",
      "agitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as she could, she went after Mary, and having found, and walked\n",
      "back with her to their former station, by the stile, felt some comfort\n",
      "in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected, and once\n",
      "more in motion together.  Her spirits wanted the solitude and silence\n",
      "which only numbers could give.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles and Henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured,\n",
      "Charles Hayter with them.  The minutiae of the business Anne could not\n",
      "attempt to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted to\n",
      "perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing on the\n",
      "gentleman's side, and a relenting on the lady's, and that they were now\n",
      "very glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt.  Henrietta\n",
      "looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--Charles Hayter\n",
      "exceedingly happy:  and they were devoted to each other almost from the\n",
      "first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth; nothing could\n",
      "be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary, or even where they\n",
      "were not, they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two.  In\n",
      "a long strip of meadow land, where there was ample space for all, they\n",
      "were thus divided, forming three distinct parties; and to that party of\n",
      "the three which boasted least animation, and least complaisance, Anne\n",
      "necessarily belonged.  She joined Charles and Mary, and was tired\n",
      "enough to be very glad of Charles's other arm; but Charles, though in\n",
      "very good humour with her, was out of temper with his wife.  Mary had\n",
      "shewn herself disobliging to him, and was now to reap the consequence,\n",
      "which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut\n",
      "off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch; and when\n",
      "Mary began to complain of it, and lament her being ill-used, according\n",
      "to custom, in being on the hedge side, while Anne was never incommoded\n",
      "on the other, he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which\n",
      "he had a momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him along at\n",
      "all.\n",
      "\n",
      "This long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of\n",
      "it was to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit,\n",
      "the carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been some time\n",
      "heard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft's gig.  He\n",
      "and his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.\n",
      "Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in, they\n",
      "kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired; it\n",
      "would save her a full mile, and they were going through Uppercross.\n",
      "The invitation was general, and generally declined.  The Miss Musgroves\n",
      "were not at all tired, and Mary was either offended, by not being asked\n",
      "before any of the others, or what Louisa called the Elliot pride could\n",
      "not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an\n",
      "opposite stile, and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again,\n",
      "when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something\n",
      "to his sister.  The something might be guessed by its effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Elliot, I am sure you are tired,\" cried Mrs Croft.  \"Do let us\n",
      "have the pleasure of taking you home.  Here is excellent room for\n",
      "three, I assure you.  If we were all like you, I believe we might sit\n",
      "four.  You must, indeed, you must.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to\n",
      "decline, she was not allowed to proceed.  The Admiral's kind urgency\n",
      "came in support of his wife's; they would not be refused; they\n",
      "compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a\n",
      "corner, and Captain Wentworth, without saying a word, turned to her,\n",
      "and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes; he had done it.  She was in the carriage, and felt that he had\n",
      "placed her there, that his will and his hands had done it, that she\n",
      "owed it to his perception of her fatigue, and his resolution to give\n",
      "her rest.  She was very much affected by the view of his disposition\n",
      "towards her, which all these things made apparent.  This little\n",
      "circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before.  She\n",
      "understood him.  He could not forgive her, but he could not be\n",
      "unfeeling.  Though condemning her for the past, and considering it with\n",
      "high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her, and\n",
      "though becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer,\n",
      "without the desire of giving her relief.  It was a remainder of former\n",
      "sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged friendship;\n",
      "it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart, which she could not\n",
      "contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain, that\n",
      "she knew not which prevailed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at\n",
      "first unconsciously given.  They had travelled half their way along the\n",
      "rough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said.  She then\n",
      "found them talking of \"Frederick.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, Sophy,\"\n",
      "said the Admiral; \"but there is no saying which.  He has been running\n",
      "after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his mind.\n",
      "Ay, this comes of the peace.  If it were war now, he would have settled\n",
      "it long ago.  We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to make long\n",
      "courtships in time of war.  How many days was it, my dear, between the\n",
      "first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our\n",
      "lodgings at North Yarmouth?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We had better not talk about it, my dear,\" replied Mrs Croft,\n",
      "pleasantly; \"for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an\n",
      "understanding, she would never be persuaded that we could be happy\n",
      "together.  I had known you by character, however, long before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we\n",
      "to wait for besides?  I do not like having such things so long in hand.\n",
      "I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home\n",
      "one of these young ladies to Kellynch.  Then there would always be\n",
      "company for them.  And very nice young ladies they both are; I hardly\n",
      "know one from the other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed,\" said Mrs Croft, in a\n",
      "tone of calmer praise, such as made Anne suspect that her keener powers\n",
      "might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother; \"and\n",
      "a very respectable family.  One could not be connected with better\n",
      "people.  My dear Admiral, that post!  we shall certainly take that\n",
      "post.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily\n",
      "passed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her\n",

      "The time now approached for Lady Russell's return:  the day was even\n",
      "fixed; and Anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she was\n",
      "resettled, was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, and\n",
      "beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth, within\n",
      "half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church, and\n",
      "there must be intercourse between the two families.  This was against\n",
      "her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time at Uppercross,\n",
      "that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him\n",
      "behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole, she believed\n",
      "she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer, almost as\n",
      "certainly as in her change of domestic society, in leaving poor Mary\n",
      "for Lady Russell.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing Captain\n",
      "Wentworth at the Hall:  those rooms had witnessed former meetings which\n",
      "would be brought too painfully before her; but she was yet more anxious\n",
      "for the possibility of Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth never meeting\n",
      "anywhere.  They did not like each other, and no renewal of acquaintance\n",
      "now could do any good; and were Lady Russell to see them together, she\n",
      "might think that he had too much self-possession, and she too little.\n",
      "\n",
      "These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal\n",
      "from Uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed quite long\n",
      "enough.  Her usefulness to little Charles would always give some\n",

      "him to go immediately to Lyme.  He had been there for four-and-twenty\n",
      "hours.  His acquittal was complete, his friendship warmly honoured, a\n",
      "lively interest excited for his friend, and his description of the fine\n",

      "for man to be more attached to woman than poor Benwick had been to\n",
      "Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful\n",
      "change.  He considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer\n",

      "adapted to Captain Benwick's state of mind.  The sympathy and good-will\n",
      "excited towards Captain Benwick was very great.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And yet,\" said Anne to herself, as they now moved forward to meet the\n",

      "rally again, and be happy with another.\"\n",

      "man, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame; and from\n",
      "strong features and want of health, looking much older than Captain\n",
      "Wentworth.  Captain Benwick looked, and was, the youngest of the three,\n",
      "and, compared with either of them, a little man.  He had a pleasing\n",
      "face and a melancholy air, just as he ought to have, and drew back from\n",
      "conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Harville, though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners,\n",
      "was a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging.  Mrs Harville,\n",
      "a degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however, to have the\n",
      "same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant than their\n",
      "desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own, because\n",
      "the friends of Captain Wentworth, or more kindly hospitable than their\n",
      "entreaties for their all promising to dine with them.  The dinner,\n",
      "already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly, accepted\n",
      "as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth should\n",
      "have brought any such party to Lyme, without considering it as a thing\n",
      "of course that they should dine with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this, and such\n",
      "a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon, so unlike\n",
      "the usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners of formality\n",
      "and display, that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by\n",
      "an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers.  \"These would\n",
      "have been all my friends,\" was her thought; and she had to struggle\n",
      "against a great tendency to lowness.\n",
      "\n",
      "On quitting the Cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends,\n",
      "and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart\n",
      "could think capable of accommodating so many.  Anne had a moment's\n",
      "astonishment on the subject herself; but it was soon lost in the\n",
      "pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious\n",
      "contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville, to turn the\n",
      "actual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies of\n",
      "lodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors against the\n",
      "winter storms to be expected.  The varieties in the fitting-up of the\n",
      "rooms, where the common necessaries provided by the owner, in the\n",
      "common indifferent plight, were contrasted with some few articles of a\n",
      "rare species of wood, excellently worked up, and with something curious\n",
      "and valuable from all the distant countries Captain Harville had\n",
      "visited, were more than amusing to Anne; connected as it all was with\n",
      "his profession, the fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence\n",
      "on his habits, the picture of repose and domestic happiness it\n",
      "presented, made it to her a something more, or less, than gratification.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Harville was no reader; but he had contrived excellent\n",
      "accommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves, for a tolerable\n",
      "collection of well-bound volumes, the property of Captain Benwick.  His\n",
      "lameness prevented him from taking much exercise; but a mind of\n",
      "usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment\n",
      "within.  He drew, he varnished, he carpentered, he glued; he made toys\n",
      "for the children; he fashioned new netting-needles and pins with\n",
      "improvements; and if everything else was done, sat down to his large\n",

      "friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness, their uprightness;\n",
      "protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and\n",

      "rather apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impulse of her\n",
      "nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him.  He was shy, and\n",
      "disposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of her countenance,\n",
      "and gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect; and Anne was well\n",
      "repaid the first trouble of exertion.  He was evidently a young man of\n",
      "considerable taste in reading, though principally in poetry; and\n",
      "besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening's\n",
      "indulgence in the discussion of subjects, which his usual companions\n",
      "had probably no concern in, she had the hope of being of real use to\n",
      "him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling\n",
      "against affliction, which had naturally grown out of their\n",

      "all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other; he\n",
      "repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines which imaged a\n",

      "second meeting, short as it was, also proved again by the gentleman's\n",
      "looks, that he thought hers very lovely, and by the readiness and\n",
      "propriety of his apologies, that he was a man of exceedingly good\n",
      "manners.  He seemed about thirty, and though not handsome, had an\n",

      "I wish I had looked at him more.  I wish we had been aware in time, who\n",
      "it was, that he might have been introduced to us.  What a pity that we\n",

      "Elliot countenance?  I hardly looked at him, I was looking at the\n",
      "horses; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance, I\n",
      "wonder the arms did not strike me!  Oh! the great-coat was hanging over\n",
      "the panel, and hid the arms, so it did; otherwise, I am sure, I should\n",

      "undoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense.  She would not,\n",
      "upon any account, mention her having met with him the second time;\n",
      "luckily Mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in\n",

      "Anne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance which she\n",

      "many years back, she knew; Elizabeth's particular share in it she\n",
      "suspected; and that Mr Elliot's idea always produced irritation in both\n",

      "him; he sent in letters, but the Grappler was under orders for\n",
      "Portsmouth.  There the news must follow him, but who was to tell it?\n",
      "not I.  I would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm.  Nobody could\n",
      "do it, but that good fellow\" (pointing to Captain Wentworth.)  \"The\n",

      "leave of absence, but without waiting the return, travelled night and\n",
      "day till he got to Portsmouth, rowed off to the Grappler that instant,\n",
      "and never left the poor fellow for a week.  That's what he did, and\n",
      "nobody else could have saved poor James.  You may think, Miss Elliot,\n",
      "whether he is dear to us!\"\n",

      "Anne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much\n",
      "in reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed able to\n",
      "bear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject, and when he\n",

      "quite walking enough by the time he reached home, determined the\n",
      "direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk; they\n",
      "would accompany them to their door, and then return and set off\n",
      "themselves.  By all their calculations there was just time for this;\n",
      "but as they drew near the Cobb, there was such a general wish to walk\n",
      "along it once more, all were so inclined, and Louisa soon grew so\n",
      "determined, that the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found,\n",
      "would be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking, and\n",
      "all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be\n",
      "imagined, they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville at their own door,\n",

      "Anne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her.  Lord Byron's \"dark\n",
      "blue seas\" could not fail of being brought forward by their present\n",
      "view, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention\n",
      "was possible.  It was soon drawn, perforce another way.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant\n",
      "for the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower, and\n",
      "all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight,\n",
      "excepting Louisa; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.\n",
      "In all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles; the\n",
      "sensation was delightful to her.  The hardness of the pavement for her\n",
      "feet, made him less willing upon the present occasion; he did it,\n",
      "however.  She was safely down, and instantly, to show her enjoyment,\n",
      "ran up the steps to be jumped down again.  He advised her against it,\n",
      "thought the jar too great; but no, he reasoned and talked in vain, she\n",
      "smiled and said, \"I am determined I will:\" he put out his hands; she\n",
      "was too precipitate by half a second, she fell on the pavement on the\n",
      "Lower Cobb, and was taken up lifeless!  There was no wound, no blood,\n",
      "no visible bruise; but her eyes were closed, she breathed not, her face\n",
      "was like death.  The horror of the moment to all who stood around!\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Wentworth, who had caught her up, knelt with her in his arms,\n",

      "silence.  \"She is dead! she is dead!\" screamed Mary, catching hold of\n",

      "immoveable; and in another moment, Henrietta, sinking under the\n",
      "conviction, lost her senses too, and would have fallen on the steps,\n",

      "\"Is there no one to help me?\" were the first words which burst from\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Go to him, go to him,\" cried Anne, \"for heaven's sake go to him.  I\n",

      "her temples; here are salts; take them, take them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Benwick obeyed, and Charles at the same moment, disengaging\n",
      "himself from his wife, they were both with him; and Louisa was raised\n",
      "up and supported more firmly between them, and everything was done that\n",
      "Anne had prompted, but in vain; while Captain Wentworth, staggering\n",
      "against the wall for his support, exclaimed in the bitterest agony--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh God! her father and mother!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"True, true, a surgeon this instant,\" was darting away, when Anne\n",
      "eagerly suggested--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick?  He knows\n",
      "where a surgeon is to be found.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea, and in a\n",
      "moment (it was all done in rapid moments) Captain Benwick had resigned\n",
      "the poor corpse-like  figure entirely to the brother's care, and was\n",
      "off for the town with the utmost rapidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said which\n",
      "of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most: Captain\n",
      "Wentworth, Anne, or Charles, who, really a very affectionate brother,\n",
      "hung over Louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his eyes from\n",
      "one sister, to see the other in a state as insensible, or to witness\n",
      "the hysterical agitations of his wife, calling on him for help which he\n",
      "could not give.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought, which\n",
      "instinct supplied, to Henrietta, still tried, at intervals, to suggest\n",
      "comfort to the others, tried to quiet Mary, to animate Charles, to\n",
      "assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth.  Both seemed to look to her\n",
      "for directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anne, Anne,\" cried Charles, \"What is to be done next?  What, in\n",

      "\n",
      "Captain Wentworth's eyes were also turned towards her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Had not she better be carried to the inn?  Yes, I am sure: carry her\n",
      "gently to the inn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, to the inn,\" repeated Captain Wentworth, comparatively\n",
      "collected, and eager to be doing something.  \"I will carry her myself.\n",
      "Musgrove, take care of the others.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen\n",

      "useful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady,\n",
      "nay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as fine as the first\n",
      "report.  To some of the best-looking of these good people Henrietta was\n",
      "consigned, for, though partially revived, she was quite helpless; and\n",
      "in this manner, Anne walking by her side, and Charles attending to his\n",
      "wife, they set forward, treading back with feelings unutterable, the\n",
      "ground, which so lately, so very lately, and so light of heart, they\n",
      "had passed along.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were not off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them.  Captain\n",
      "Benwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance which\n",
      "showed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately,\n",
      "informed and directed as they passed, towards the spot.  Shocked as\n",
      "Captain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves that could be\n",
      "instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife decided what was\n",
      "to be done.  She must be taken to their house; all must go to their\n",
      "house; and await the surgeon's arrival there.  They would not listen to\n",
      "scruples:  he was obeyed; they were all beneath his roof; and while\n",
      "Louisa, under Mrs Harville's direction, was conveyed up stairs, and\n",
      "given possession of her own bed, assistance, cordials, restoratives\n",
      "were supplied by her husband to all who needed them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Louisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again, without\n",
      "apparent consciousness.  This had been a proof of life, however, of\n",
      "service to her sister; and Henrietta, though perfectly incapable of\n",
      "being in the same room with Louisa, was kept, by the agitation of hope\n",
      "and fear, from a return of her own insensibility.  Mary, too, was\n",
      "growing calmer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible.  They\n",
      "were sick with horror, while he examined; but he was not hopeless.  The\n",
      "head had received a severe contusion, but he had seen greater injuries\n",
      "recovered from:  he was by no means hopeless; he spoke cheerfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "That he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say a\n",
      "few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most; and\n",
      "the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent, after a\n",
      "few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered, may\n",
      "be conceived.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tone, the look, with which \"Thank God!\" was uttered by Captain\n",
      "Wentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her; nor the sight\n",
      "of him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it with folded\n",
      "arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by the various feelings of\n",
      "his soul, and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Louisa's limbs had escaped.  There was no injury but to the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be\n",
      "done, as to their general situation.  They were now able to speak to\n",
      "each other and consult.  That Louisa must remain where she was, however\n",
      "distressing to her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such\n",
      "trouble, did not admit a doubt.  Her removal was impossible.  The\n",
      "Harvilles silenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, all\n",
      "gratitude.  They had looked forward and arranged everything before the\n",
      "others began to reflect.  Captain Benwick must give up his room to\n",
      "them, and get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled.  They\n",
      "were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more; and yet\n",
      "perhaps, by \"putting the children away in the maid's room, or swinging\n",
      "a cot somewhere,\" they could hardly bear to think of not finding room\n",
      "for two or three besides, supposing they might wish to stay; though,\n",
      "with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove, there need not be the\n",
      "least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville's care entirely.  Mrs\n",
      "Harville was a very experienced nurse, and her nursery-maid, who had\n",
      "lived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere, was just such\n",
      "another.  Between these two, she could want no possible attendance by\n",
      "day or night.  And all this was said with a truth and sincerity of\n",
      "feeling irresistible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles, Henrietta, and Captain Wentworth were the three in\n",
      "consultation, and for a little while it was only an interchange of\n",
      "perplexity and terror.  \"Uppercross, the necessity of some one's going\n",
      "to Uppercross; the news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to Mr\n",
      "and Mrs Musgrove; the lateness of the morning; an hour already gone\n",
      "since they ought to have been off; the impossibility of being in\n",
      "tolerable time.\" At first, they were capable of nothing more to the\n",
      "purpose than such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth,\n",
      "exerting himself, said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute.  Every\n",
      "minute is valuable.  Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercross\n",
      "instantly.  Musgrove, either you or I must go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away.  He\n",
      "would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville;\n",
      "but as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, nor\n",
      "would.  So far it was decided; and Henrietta at first declared the\n",
      "same.  She, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.  The\n",
      "usefulness of her staying!  She who had not been able to remain in\n",
      "Louisa's room, or to look at her, without sufferings which made her\n",
      "worse than helpless!  She was forced to acknowledge that she could do\n",
      "no good, yet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the\n",
      "thought of her father and mother, she gave it up; she consented, she\n",
      "was anxious to be at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan had reached this point, when Anne, coming quietly down from\n",
      "Louisa's room, could not but hear what followed, for the parlour door\n",
      "was open.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then it is settled, Musgrove,\" cried Captain Wentworth, \"that you\n",
      "stay, and that I take care of your sister home.  But as to the rest, as\n",
      "to the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville, I think it need be\n",
      "only one.  Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course, wish to get back to\n",
      "her children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper, so capable as\n",
      "Anne.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so\n",
      "spoken of.  The other two warmly agreed with what he said, and she then\n",
      "appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her;\" cried he,\n",
      "turning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness, which\n",
      "seemed almost restoring the past.  She coloured deeply, and he\n",
      "recollected himself and moved away.  She expressed herself most\n",
      "willing, ready, happy to remain.  \"It was what she had been thinking\n",
      "of, and wishing to be allowed to do.  A bed on the floor in Louisa's\n",
      "room would be sufficient for her, if Mrs Harville would but think so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing more, and all seemed arranged.  Though it was rather\n",
      "desirable that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some\n",
      "share of delay; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses to take\n",
      "them back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense; and Captain\n",
      "Wentworth proposed, and Charles Musgrove agreed, that it would be much\n",
      "better for him to take a chaise from the inn, and leave Mr Musgrove's\n",
      "carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early, when there\n",
      "would be the farther advantage of sending an account of Louisa's night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part,\n",
      "and to be soon followed by the two ladies.  When the plan was made\n",
      "known to Mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it.  She was\n",
      "so wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice in being\n",
      "expected to go away instead of Anne; Anne, who was nothing to Louisa,\n",
      "while she was her sister, and had the best right to stay in Henrietta's\n",
      "stead!  Why was not she to be as useful as Anne?  And to go home\n",
      "without Charles, too, without her husband!  No, it was too unkind.  And\n",
      "in short, she said more than her husband could long withstand, and as\n",
      "none of the others could oppose when he gave way, there was no help for\n",
      "it; the change of Mary for Anne was inevitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and\n",
      "ill-judging claims of Mary; but so it must be, and they set off for the\n",
      "town, Charles taking care of his sister, and Captain Benwick attending\n",
      "to her.  She gave a moment's recollection, as they hurried along, to\n",
      "the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in\n",
      "the morning.  There she had listened to Henrietta's schemes for Dr\n",
      "Shirley's leaving Uppercross; farther on, she had first seen Mr Elliot;\n",
      "a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa, or\n",
      "those who were wrapt up in her welfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and, united as\n",
      "they all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt an increasing\n",
      "degree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even in thinking that\n",
      "it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in\n",
      "waiting, stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the\n",
      "street; but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of\n",
      "one sister for the other, the change in his countenance, the\n",
      "astonishment, the expressions begun and suppressed, with which Charles\n",
      "was listened to, made but a mortifying reception of Anne; or must at\n",
      "least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to\n",
      "Louisa.\n",
      "\n",
      "She endeavoured to be composed, and to be just.  Without emulating the\n",
      "feelings of an Emma towards her Henry, she would have attended on\n",
      "Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard, for his sake; and\n",
      "she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink\n",
      "unnecessarily from the office of a friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meanwhile she was in the carriage.  He had handed them both in,\n",
      "and placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these\n",
      "circumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to Anne, she quitted\n",
      "Lyme.  How the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their\n",
      "manners; what was to be their sort of intercourse, she could not\n",
      "foresee.  It was all quite natural, however.  He was devoted to\n",
      "Henrietta; always turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, always\n",
      "with the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits.  In\n",
      "general, his voice and manner were studiously calm.  To spare Henrietta\n",
      "from agitation seemed the governing principle.  Once only, when she had\n",
      "been grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated walk to the Cobb,\n",
      "bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of, he burst forth, as\n",
      "if wholly overcome--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't talk of it, don't talk of it,\" he cried.  \"Oh God! that I had\n",
      "not given way to her at the fatal moment!  Had I done as I ought!  But\n",
      "so eager and so resolute! Dear, sweet Louisa!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the\n",
      "justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and\n",
      "advantage of firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him\n",
      "that, like all other qualities of the mind, it should have its\n",
      "proportions and limits.  She thought it could scarcely escape him to\n",
      "feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of\n",
      "happiness as a very resolute character.\n",
      "\n",
      "They got on fast.  Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and\n",
      "the same objects so soon.  Their actual speed, heightened by some dread\n",
      "of the conclusion, made the road appear but half as long as on the day\n",
      "before.  It was growing quite dusk, however, before they were in the\n",
      "neighbourhood of Uppercross, and there had been total silence among\n",
      "them for some time, Henrietta leaning back in the corner, with a shawl\n",
      "over her face, giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep;\n",
      "when, as they were going up their last hill, Anne found herself all at\n",
      "once addressed by Captain Wentworth.  In a low, cautious voice, he\n",
      "said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have been considering what we had best do.  She must not appear at\n",
      "first.  She could not stand it.  I have been thinking whether you had\n",
      "not better remain in the carriage with her, while I go in and break it\n",
      "to Mr and Mrs Musgrove.  Do you think this is a good plan?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She did:  he was satisfied, and said no more.  But the remembrance of\n",
      "the appeal remained a pleasure to her, as a proof of friendship, and of\n",
      "deference for her judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became a\n",
      "sort of parting proof, its value did not lessen.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over, and he had\n",

      "days, was spent entirely at the Mansion House; and she had the\n",
      "satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there, both as an\n",
      "immediate companion, and as assisting in all those arrangements for the\n",
      "future, which, in Mr and Mrs Musgrove's distressed state of spirits,\n",
      "would have been difficulties.\n",

      "They had an early account from Lyme the next morning.  Louisa was much\n",
      "the same.  No symptoms worse than before had appeared.  Charles came a\n",
      "few hours afterwards, to bring a later and more particular account.  He\n",
      "was tolerably cheerful.  A speedy cure must not be hoped, but\n",
      "everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted.  In\n",
      "speaking of the Harvilles, he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of\n",
      "their kindness, especially of Mrs Harville's exertions as a nurse.\n",
      "\"She really left nothing for Mary to do.  He and Mary had been\n",
      "persuaded to go early to their inn last night.  Mary had been\n",
      "hysterical again this morning.  When he came away, she was going to\n",
      "walk out with Captain Benwick, which, he hoped, would do her good.  He\n",
      "almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before;\n",
      "but the truth was, that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his father had at\n",
      "first half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent.  It\n",
      "would be going only to multiply trouble to the others, and increase his\n",
      "own distress; and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon.  A\n",
      "chaise was sent for from Crewkherne, and Charles conveyed back a far\n",
      "more useful person in the old nursery-maid of the family, one who\n",
      "having brought up all the children, and seen the very last, the\n",
      "lingering and long-petted Master Harry, sent to school after his\n",
      "brothers, was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and\n",
      "dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her, and who,\n",
      "consequently, was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse\n",
      "dear Miss Louisa.  Vague wishes of getting Sarah thither, had occurred\n",
      "before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta; but without Anne, it would hardly\n",
      "have been resolved on, and found practicable so soon.\n",

      "They were indebted, the next day, to Charles Hayter, for all the minute\n",
      "knowledge of Louisa, which it was so essential to obtain every\n",
      "twenty-four hours.  He made it his business to go to Lyme, and his\n",
      "account was still encouraging.  The intervals of sense and\n",
      "consciousness were believed to be stronger.  Every report agreed in\n",
      "Captain Wentworth's appearing fixed in Lyme.\n",

      "Anne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded.\n",
      "\"What should they do without her?  They were wretched comforters for\n",

      "could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to\n",
      "which she was privy, and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once.  She\n",
      "had little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go; go\n",
      "to-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings, as it\n",
      "suited, and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved.  They must be\n",
      "taking off some trouble from the good people she was with; they might\n",
      "at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children; and in\n",
      "short, they were so happy in the decision, that Anne was delighted with\n",
      "what she had done, and felt that she could not spend her last morning\n",
      "at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations, and sending\n",
      "them off at an early hour, though her being left to the solitary range\n",
      "of the house was the consequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage, she was the\n",

      "A few days had made a change indeed!\n",
      "\n",
      "If Louisa recovered, it would all be well again.  More than former\n",
      "happiness would be restored.  There could not be a doubt, to her mind\n",
      "there was none, of what would follow her recovery.  A few months hence,\n",
      "and the room now so deserted, occupied but by her silent, pensive self,\n",

      "November day, a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few\n",
      "objects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough to make the\n",

      "desirous to be gone, she could not quit the Mansion House, or look an\n",
      "adieu to the Cottage, with its black, dripping and comfortless veranda,\n",
      "or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of\n",
      "the village, without a saddened heart.  Scenes had passed in Uppercross\n",
      "which made it precious.  It stood the record of many sensations of\n",
      "pain, once severe, but now softened; and of some instances of relenting\n",
      "feeling, some breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which could\n",
      "never be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear.  She\n",
      "left it all behind her, all but the recollection that such things had\n",
      "been.\n",

      "in September.  It had not been necessary, and the few occasions of its\n",

      "escape from.  Her first return was to resume her place in the modern\n",

      "\n",
      "There was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell's joy in meeting her.\n",
      "She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross.  But happily, either Anne\n",
      "was improved in plumpness and looks, or Lady Russell fancied her so;\n",
      "and Anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion, had the\n",
      "amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin,\n",
      "and of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth\n",
      "and beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they came to converse, she was soon sensible of some mental\n",

      "Kellynch, and which she had felt slighted, and been compelled to\n",
      "smother among the Musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest.\n",
      "She had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath.\n",

      "and Louisa Musgrove, and all her acquaintance there; how much more\n",
      "interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and\n",

      "solicitude, on topics which had by nature the first claim on her.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another\n",
      "subject.  They must speak of the accident at Lyme.  Lady Russell had\n",
      "not been arrived five minutes the day before, when a full account of\n",
      "the whole had burst on her; but still it must be talked of, she must\n",
      "make enquiries, she must regret the imprudence, lament the result, and\n",
      "Captain Wentworth's name must be mentioned by both.  Anne was conscious\n",
      "of not doing it so well as Lady Russell.  She could not speak the name,\n",
      "and look straight forward to Lady Russell's eye, till she had adopted\n",
      "the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment\n",
      "between him and Louisa.  When this was told, his name distressed her no\n",
      "longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy, but\n",
      "internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt,\n",
      "that the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat of\n",
      "the value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years afterwards, be charmed\n",
      "by a Louisa Musgrove.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance\n",
      "to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme, which\n",
      "found their way to Anne, she could not tell how, and brought a rather\n",
      "improving account of Louisa.  At the end of that period, Lady Russell's\n",
      "politeness could repose no longer, and the fainter self-threatenings of\n",
      "the past became in a decided tone, \"I must call on Mrs Croft; I really\n",
      "must call upon her soon.  Anne, have you courage to go with me, and pay\n",
      "a visit in that house?  It will be some trial to us both.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she truly felt as she\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two; your\n",
      "feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine.  By remaining in\n",
      "the neighbourhood, I am become inured to it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact so high an\n",
      "opinion of the Crofts, and considered her father so very fortunate in\n",
      "his tenants, felt the parish to be so sure of a good example, and the\n",
      "poor of the best attention and relief, that however sorry and ashamed\n",
      "for the necessity of the removal, she could not but in conscience feel\n",
      "that they were gone who deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall\n",
      "had passed into better hands than its owners'.  These convictions must\n",
      "unquestionably have their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they\n",
      "precluded that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the\n",
      "house again, and returning through the well-known apartments.\n",
      "\n",
      "In such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself, \"These rooms\n",
      "ought to belong only to us.  Oh, how fallen in their destination!  How\n",
      "unworthily occupied!  An ancient family to be so driven away!\n",
      "Strangers filling their place!\" No, except when she thought of her\n",
      "mother, and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside, she\n",
      "had no sigh of that description to heave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of\n",
      "fancying herself a favourite, and on the present occasion, receiving\n",
      "her in that house, there was particular attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic, and on\n",
      "comparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared that each\n",
      "lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn; that\n",
      "Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday (the first time since\n",
      "the accident), had brought Anne the last note, which she had not been\n",
      "able to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours and then\n",
      "returned again to Lyme, and without any present intention of quitting\n",
      "it any more.  He had enquired after her, she found, particularly; had\n",
      "expressed his hope of Miss Elliot's not being the worse for her\n",
      "exertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great.  This was\n",
      "handsome, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could\n",
      "have done.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one\n",
      "style by a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to\n",
      "work on ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had\n",
      "been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence; that\n",
      "its effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think, how\n",
      "long Miss Musgrove's recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable she\n",
      "would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!  The\n",
      "Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ay, a very bad business indeed.  A new sort of way this, for a young\n",
      "fellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress's head, is not it,\n",
      "Miss Elliot?  This is breaking a head and giving a plaster, truly!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Admiral Croft's manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady\n",
      "Russell, but they delighted Anne.  His goodness of heart and simplicity\n",
      "of character were irresistible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, this must be very bad for you,\" said he, suddenly rousing from a\n",
      "little reverie, \"to be coming and finding us here.  I had not\n",
      "recollected it before, I declare, but it must be very bad.  But now, do\n",
      "not stand upon ceremony.  Get up and go over all the rooms in the house\n",
      "if you like it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Another time, Sir, I thank you, not now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, whenever it suits you.  You can slip in from the shrubbery at\n",
      "any time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by\n",
      "that door.  A good place is not it?  But,\" (checking himself), \"you\n",
      "will not think it a good place, for yours were always kept in the\n",
      "butler's room.  Ay, so it always is, I believe.  One man's ways may be\n",
      "as good as another's, but we all like our own best.  And so you must\n",
      "judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you to go about the\n",
      "house or not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne, finding she might decline it, did so, very gratefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have made very few changes either,\" continued the Admiral, after\n",
      "thinking a moment.  \"Very few.  We told you about the laundry-door, at\n",
      "Uppercross.  That has been a very great improvement.  The wonder was,\n",
      "how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its\n",
      "opening as it did, so long!  You will tell Sir Walter what we have\n",
      "done, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house\n",
      "ever had.  Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say, that the few\n",
      "alterations we have made have been all very much for the better.  My\n",
      "wife should have the credit of them, however.  I have done very little\n",
      "besides sending away some of the large looking-glasses from my\n",
      "dressing-room, which was your father's.  A very good man, and very much\n",
      "the gentleman I am sure: but I should think, Miss Elliot,\" (looking\n",
      "with serious reflection), \"I should think he must be rather a dressy\n",
      "man for his time of life.  Such a number of looking-glasses! oh Lord!\n",
      "there was no getting away from one's self.  So I got Sophy to lend me a\n",
      "hand, and we soon shifted their quarters; and now I am quite snug, with\n",
      "my little shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing that I\n",
      "never go near.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer,\n",
      "and the Admiral, fearing he might not have been civil enough, took up\n",
      "the subject again, to say--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot, pray give\n",
      "him my compliments and Mrs Croft's, and say that we are settled here\n",
      "quite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find with the place.\n",
      "The breakfast-room chimney smokes a little, I grant you, but it is only\n",
      "when the wind is due north and blows hard, which may not happen three\n",
      "times a winter.  And take it altogether, now that we have been into\n",
      "most of the houses hereabouts and can judge, there is not one that we\n",
      "like better than this.  Pray say so, with my compliments.  He will be\n",
      "glad to hear it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other: but\n",
      "the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at\n",
      "present; for when it was returned, the Crofts announced themselves to\n",
      "be going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions in the north\n",
      "of the county, and probably might not be at home again before Lady\n",
      "Russell would be removing to Bath.\n",
      "\n",
      "So ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch\n",
      "Hall, or of seeing him in company with her friend.  Everything was safe\n",

      "wanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again; and\n",
      "as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to\n",
      "the Lodge.  They had left Louisa beginning to sit up; but her head,\n",
      "though clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves susceptible to the\n",
      "highest extreme of tenderness; and though she might be pronounced to be\n",

      "there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles,\n",

      "and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at\n",

      "sort of excuse; 'he never shot' and he had 'been quite misunderstood,'\n",
      "and he had promised this and he had promised that, and the end of it\n",
      "was, I found, that he did not mean to come.  I suppose he was afraid of\n",

      "your recommendation, and he wants to talk to you about them; he has\n",
      "found out something or other in one of them which he thinks--oh! I\n",
      "cannot pretend to remember it, but it was something very fine--I\n",
      "overheard him telling Henrietta all about it; and then 'Miss Elliot'\n",
      "was spoken of in the highest terms!  Now Mary, I declare it was so, I\n",
      "heard it myself, and you were in the other room.  'Elegance, sweetness,\n",
      "beauty.' Oh! there was no end of Miss Elliot's charms.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I am sure,\" cried Mary, warmly, \"it was a very little to his\n",
      "credit, if he did.  Miss Harville only died last June.  Such a heart is\n",
      "very little worth having; is it, Lady Russell?  I am sure you will\n",
      "agree with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must see Captain Benwick before I decide,\" said Lady Russell,\n",
      "smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma'am,\"\n",
      "said Charles.  \"Though he had not nerves for coming away with us, and\n",
      "setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here, he will make\n",
      "his way over to Kellynch one day by himself, you may depend on it.  I\n",
      "told him the distance and the road, and I told him of the church's\n",
      "being so very well worth seeing; for as he has a taste for those sort\n",
      "of things, I thought that would be a good excuse, and he listened with\n",
      "all his understanding and soul; and I am sure from his manner that you\n",
      "will have him calling here soon.  So, I give you notice, Lady Russell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Any acquaintance of Anne's will always be welcome to me,\" was Lady\n",
      "Russell's kind answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! as to being Anne's acquaintance,\" said Mary, \"I think he is rather\n",
      "my acquaintance, for I have been seeing him every day this last\n",
      "fortnight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, as your joint acquaintance, then, I shall be very happy to see\n",
      "Captain Benwick.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will not find anything very agreeable in him, I assure you, ma'am.\n",
      "He is one of the dullest young men that ever lived.  He has walked with\n",
      "me, sometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a\n",
      "word.  He is not at all a well-bred young man.  I am sure you will not\n",
      "like him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There we differ, Mary,\" said Anne.  \"I think Lady Russell would like\n",
      "him.  I think she would be so much pleased with his mind, that she\n",
      "would very soon see no deficiency in his manner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So do I, Anne,\" said Charles.  \"I am sure Lady Russell would like him.\n",
      "He is just Lady Russell's sort.  Give him a book, and he will read all\n",
      "day long.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that he will!\" exclaimed Mary, tauntingly.  \"He will sit poring\n",
      "over his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one\n",
      "drops one's scissors, or anything that happens.  Do you think Lady\n",
      "Russell would like that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Russell could not help laughing.  \"Upon my word,\" said she, \"I\n",
      "should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted\n",
      "of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact as I may\n",
      "call myself.  I have really a curiosity to see the person who can give\n",
      "occasion to such directly opposite notions.  I wish he may be induced\n",
      "to call here.  And when he does, Mary, you may depend upon hearing my\n",
      "opinion; but I am determined not to judge him beforehand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will not like him, I will answer for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Russell began talking of something else.  Mary spoke with\n",
      "animation of their meeting with, or rather missing, Mr Elliot so\n",
      "extraordinarily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is a man,\" said Lady Russell, \"whom I have no wish to see.  His\n",
      "declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family, has left\n",
      "a very strong impression in his disfavour with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This decision checked Mary's eagerness, and stopped her short in the\n",
      "midst of the Elliot countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anne hazarded no enquiries,\n",
      "there was voluntary communication sufficient.  His spirits had been\n",
      "greatly recovering lately as might be expected.  As Louisa improved, he\n",
      "had improved, and he was now quite a different creature from what he\n",
      "had been the first week.  He had not seen Louisa; and was so extremely\n",
      "fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview, that he did\n",
      "not press for it at all; and, on the contrary, seemed to have a plan of\n",
      "going away for a week or ten days, till her head was stronger.  He had\n",
      "talked of going down to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade\n",
      "Captain Benwick to go with him; but, as Charles maintained to the last,\n",
      "Captain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch.\n",
      "\n",
      "There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally\n",
      "thinking of Captain Benwick, from this time.  Lady Russell could not\n",
      "hear the door-bell without feeling that it might be his herald; nor\n",
      "could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her\n",
      "father's grounds, or any visit of charity in the village, without\n",
      "wondering whether she might see him or hear of him.  Captain Benwick\n",
      "came not, however.  He was either less disposed for it than Charles had\n",
      "imagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him a week's indulgence,\n",
      "Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had\n",
      "been beginning to excite.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from\n",
      "school, bringing with them Mrs Harville's little children, to improve\n",
      "the noise of Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme.  Henrietta remained\n",
      "with Louisa; but all the rest of the family were again in their usual\n",
      "quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once, when Anne\n",
      "could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again.\n",
      "Though neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter, nor Captain\n",
      "Wentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast as could\n",
      "be wished to the last state she had seen it in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles, whom\n",
      "she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from\n",
      "the Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.  On one side was a table\n",
      "occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk and gold paper; and\n",
      "on the other were tressels and trays, bending under the weight of brawn\n",
      "and cold pies, where riotous boys were holding high revel; the whole\n",
      "completed by a roaring Christmas fire, which seemed determined to be\n",
      "heard, in spite of all the noise of the others.  Charles and Mary also\n",
      "came in, of course, during their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of\n",
      "paying his respects to Lady Russell, and sat down close to her for ten\n",
      "minutes, talking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the\n",
      "children on his knees, generally in vain.  It was a fine family-piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed such a\n",
      "domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves, which Louisa's\n",
      "illness must have so greatly shaken.  But Mrs Musgrove, who got Anne\n",
      "near her on purpose to thank her most cordially, again and again, for\n",
      "all her attentions to them, concluded a short recapitulation of what\n",
      "she had suffered herself by observing, with a happy glance round the\n",
      "room, that after all she had gone through, nothing was so likely to do\n",
      "her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Louisa was now recovering apace.  Her mother could even think of her\n",
      "being able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisters\n",
      "went to school again.  The Harvilles had promised to come with her and\n",
      "stay at Uppercross, whenever she returned.  Captain Wentworth was gone,\n",
      "for the present, to see his brother in Shropshire.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope I shall remember, in future,\" said Lady Russell, as soon as\n",
      "they were reseated in the carriage, \"not to call at Uppercross in the\n",
      "Christmas holidays.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters; and\n",
      "sounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort rather\n",
      "than their quantity.  When Lady Russell not long afterwards, was\n",
      "entering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through the long course\n",
      "of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place, amidst the dash of\n",
      "other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays, the bawling of\n",
      "newspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless clink of\n",
      "pattens, she made no complaint.  No, these were noises which belonged\n",
      "to the winter pleasures; her spirits rose under their influence; and\n",
      "like Mrs Musgrove, she was feeling, though not saying, that after being\n",
      "long in the country, nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet\n",
      "cheerfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne did not share these feelings.  She persisted in a very determined,\n",
      "though very silent disinclination for Bath; caught the first dim view\n",
      "of the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish of seeing\n",
      "them better; felt their progress through the streets to be, however\n",
      "disagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her when she\n",
      "arrived?  And looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles of\n",
      "Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth's last letter had communicated a piece of news of some\n",
      "interest.  Mr Elliot was in Bath.  He had called in Camden Place; had\n",
      "called a second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.  If\n",
      "Elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking\n",
      "much pains to seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the\n",
      "connection, as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.  This was\n",
      "very wonderful if it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of very\n",
      "agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot, already recanting\n",
      "the sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary, of his being \"a man\n",
      "whom she had no wish to see.\"  She had a great wish to see him.  If he\n",
      "really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be\n",
      "forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance, but she\n",
      "felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not, which was more\n",
      "than she could say for many other persons in Bath.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was put down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove to her\n",

      "Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place, a lofty\n",
      "dignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence; and both he\n",
      "and Elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment of\n",
      "many months, and anxiously saying to herself, \"Oh! when shall I leave\n",
      "you again?\"  A degree of unexpected cordiality, however, in the welcome\n",
      "she received, did her good.  Her father and sister were glad to see\n",
      "her, for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture, and met her\n",
      "with kindness.  Her making a fourth, when they sat down to dinner, was\n",
      "noticed as an advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her courtesies and\n",
      "smiles were more a matter of course.  Anne had always felt that she\n",
      "would pretend what was proper on her arrival, but the complaisance of\n",
      "the others was unlooked for.  They were evidently in excellent spirits,\n",
      "and she was soon to listen to the causes.  They had no inclination to\n",
      "listen to her.  After laying out for some compliments of being deeply\n",
      "regretted in their old neighbourhood, which Anne could not pay, they\n",
      "had only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be all\n",
      "their own.  Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little: it\n",
      "was all Bath.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered\n",
      "their expectations in every respect.  Their house was undoubtedly the\n",
      "best in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages\n",
      "over all the others which they had either seen or heard of, and the\n",
      "superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up, or the taste\n",
      "of the furniture.  Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after.\n",
      "Everybody was wanting to visit them.  They had drawn back from many\n",
      "introductions, and still were perpetually having cards left by people\n",
      "of whom they knew nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here were funds of enjoyment.  Could Anne wonder that her father and\n",
      "sister were happy?  She might not wonder, but she must sigh that her\n",
      "father should feel no degradation in his change, should see nothing to\n",
      "regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder, should\n",
      "find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town; and she must\n",
      "sigh, and smile, and wonder too, as Elizabeth threw open the\n",
      "folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room to the\n",
      "other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman, who\n",
      "had been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud of\n",
      "between two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this was not all which they had to make them happy.  They had Mr\n",
      "Elliot too.  Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot.  He was not\n",
      "only pardoned, they were delighted with him.  He had been in Bath about\n",
      "a fortnight; (he had passed through Bath in November, in his way to\n",
      "London, when the intelligence of Sir Walter's being settled there had\n",
      "of course reached him, though only twenty-four hours in the place, but\n",
      "he had not been able to avail himself of it;) but he had now been a\n",
      "fortnight in Bath, and his first object on arriving, had been to leave\n",
      "his card in Camden Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours\n",
      "to meet, and when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct,\n",
      "such readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be\n",
      "received as a relation again, that their former good understanding was\n",
      "completely re-established.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had not a fault to find in him.  He had explained away all the\n",
      "appearance of neglect on his own side.  It had originated in\n",
      "misapprehension entirely.  He had never had an idea of throwing himself\n",
      "off; he had feared that he was thrown off, but knew not why, and\n",
      "delicacy had kept him silent.  Upon the hint of having spoken\n",
      "disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours, he\n",
      "was quite indignant.  He, who had ever boasted of being an Elliot, and\n",
      "whose feelings, as to connection, were only too strict to suit the\n",
      "unfeudal tone of the present day.  He was astonished, indeed, but his\n",
      "character and general conduct must refute it.  He could refer Sir\n",
      "Walter to all who knew him; and certainly, the pains he had been taking\n",
      "on this, the first opportunity of reconciliation, to be restored to the\n",
      "footing of a relation and heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his\n",
      "opinions on the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "The circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of much\n",
      "extenuation.  This was an article not to be entered on by himself; but\n",
      "a very intimate friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a highly respectable\n",
      "man, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man, Sir Walter\n",
      "added), who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings, and\n",
      "had, at his own particular request, been admitted to their acquaintance\n",
      "through Mr Elliot, had mentioned one or two things relative to the\n",
      "marriage, which made a material difference in the discredit of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long, had been well acquainted also\n",
      "with his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.  She was\n",
      "certainly not a woman of family, but well educated, accomplished, rich,\n",
      "and excessively in love with his friend.  There had been the charm.\n",
      "She had sought him.  Without that attraction, not all her money would\n",
      "have tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was, moreover, assured of her\n",
      "having been a very fine woman.  Here was a great deal to soften the\n",
      "business.  A very fine woman with a large fortune, in love with him!\n",
      "Sir Walter seemed to admit it as complete apology; and though Elizabeth\n",
      "could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light, she\n",
      "allowed it be a great extenuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once, evidently\n",
      "delighted by the distinction of being asked, for they gave no dinners\n",
      "in general; delighted, in short, by every proof of cousinly notice, and\n",
      "placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne listened, but without quite understanding it.  Allowances, large\n",
      "allowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke.\n",
      "She heard it all under embellishment.  All that sounded extravagant or\n",
      "irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin\n",
      "but in the language of the relators.  Still, however, she had the\n",
      "sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared, in\n",
      "Mr Elliot's wishing, after an interval of so many years, to be well\n",
      "received by them.  In a worldly view, he had nothing to gain by being\n",
      "on terms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance.  In\n",
      "all probability he was already the richer of the two, and the Kellynch\n",
      "estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title.  A sensible man,\n",
      "and he had looked like a very sensible man, why should it be an object\n",
      "to him?  She could only offer one solution; it was, perhaps, for\n",
      "Elizabeth's sake.  There might really have been a liking formerly,\n",
      "though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way; and now\n",
      "that he could afford to please himself, he might mean to pay his\n",
      "addresses to her.  Elizabeth was certainly very handsome, with\n",
      "well-bred, elegant manners, and her character might never have been\n",
      "penetrated by Mr Elliot, knowing her but in public, and when very young\n",
      "himself.  How her temper and understanding might bear the investigation\n",
      "of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a\n",
      "fearful one.  Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too\n",
      "nice, or too observant if Elizabeth were his object; and that Elizabeth\n",
      "was disposed to believe herself so, and that her friend Mrs Clay was\n",
      "encouraging the idea, seemed apparent by a glance or two between them,\n",
      "while Mr Elliot's frequent visits were talked of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme, but without\n",
      "being much attended to.  \"Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliot.\n",
      "They did not know.  It might be him, perhaps.\"  They could not listen\n",
      "to her description of him.  They were describing him themselves; Sir\n",
      "Walter especially.  He did justice to his very gentlemanlike\n",
      "appearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face, his\n",
      "sensible eye; but, at the same time, \"must lament his being very much\n",
      "under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased; nor could he\n",
      "pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for\n",
      "the worse.  Mr Elliot appeared to think that he (Sir Walter) was\n",
      "looking exactly as he had done when they last parted;\" but Sir Walter\n",
      "had \"not been able to return the compliment entirely, which had\n",
      "embarrassed him.  He did not mean to complain, however.  Mr Elliot was\n",
      "better to look at than most men, and he had no objection to being seen\n",
      "with him anywhere.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Elliot, and his friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of the\n",
      "whole evening.  \"Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be introduced\n",
      "to them! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should!\" and there was a Mrs\n",
      "Wallis, at present known only to them by description, as she was in\n",
      "daily expectation of her confinement; but Mr Elliot spoke of her as \"a\n",
      "most charming woman, quite worthy of being known in Camden Place,\" and\n",
      "as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted.  Sir Walter\n",
      "thought much of Mrs Wallis; she was said to be an excessively pretty\n",
      "woman, beautiful.  \"He longed to see her.  He hoped she might make some\n",
      "amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the\n",
      "streets.  The worst of Bath was the number of its plain women.  He did\n",
      "not mean to say that there were no pretty women, but the number of the\n",
      "plain was out of all proportion.  He had frequently observed, as he\n",
      "walked, that one handsome face would be followed by thirty, or\n",
      "five-and-thirty frights; and once, as he had stood in a shop on Bond\n",
      "Street, he had counted eighty-seven women go by, one after another,\n",
      "without there being a tolerable face among them.  It had been a frosty\n",

      "exactly what they ought to be, so polished, so easy, so particularly\n",

      "especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to\n",
      "be guests in the same inn at the same time; to give his own route,\n",
      "understand something of hers, and regret that he should have lost such\n",
      "an opportunity of paying his respects to her.  She gave him a short\n",
      "account of her party and business at Lyme.  His regret increased as he\n",

      "adjoining theirs; had heard voices, mirth continually; thought they\n",
      "must be a most delightful set of people, longed to be with them, but\n",
      "certainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow\n",

      "almost ready to exclaim, \"Can this be Mr Elliot?\" and could not\n",
      "seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man.\n",
      "Everything united in him; good understanding, correct opinions,\n",
      "knowledge of the world, and a warm heart.  He had strong feelings of\n",

      "lived with the liberality of a man of fortune, without display; he\n",

      "what was amiable and lovely, and a value for all the felicities of\n",
      "domestic life, which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent\n",
      "agitation seldom really possess.  She was sure that he had not been\n",
      "happy in marriage.  Colonel Wallis said it, and Lady Russell saw it;\n",
      "but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind, nor (she began pretty\n",

      "it must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months.  A little\n",

      "see the crape round his hat, without fearing that she was the\n",
      "inexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations; for though\n",
      "his marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed so many\n",

      "have as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of, as herself.\n",
      "They went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many\n",
      "times.  He gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with\n",

      "better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life, and\n",
      "was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen; a wish that\n",

      "case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by\n",
      "letters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount,\n",
      "when, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter's at the same\n",
      "time, there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch.  No letter of\n",
      "condolence had been sent to Ireland.  The neglect had been visited on\n",
      "the head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot died herself, no\n",
      "letter of condolence was received at Kellynch, and, consequently, there\n",
      "was but too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered the\n",
      "relationship as closed.  How to have this anxious business set to\n",
      "rights, and be admitted as cousins again, was the question:  and it was\n",
      "a question which, in a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell nor\n",
      "Mr Elliot thought unimportant.  \"Family connexions were always worth\n",
      "preserving, good company always worth seeking; Lady Dalrymple had taken\n",
      "a house, for three months, in Laura Place, and would be living in\n",
      "style.  She had been at Bath the year before, and Lady Russell had\n",
      "heard her spoken of as a charming woman.  It was very desirable that\n",
      "the connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any\n",
      "compromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Walter, however, would choose his own means, and at last wrote a\n",
      "very fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty, to his\n",
      "right honourable cousin.  Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot could\n",
      "admire the letter; but it did all that was wanted, in bringing three\n",
      "lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess.  \"She was very much\n",
      "honoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance.\" The toils of the\n",

      "agreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they\n",

      "accomplishment, or understanding.  Lady Dalrymple had acquired the name\n",
      "of \"a charming woman,\" because she had a smile and a civil answer for\n",
      "everybody.  Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain and so\n",
      "awkward, that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place but\n",
      "for her birth.\n",

      "themselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion, as good\n",

      "are essential; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing\n",

      "any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be so\n",

      "She was a widow and poor.  Her husband had been extravagant; and at his\n",
      "death, about two years before, had left his affairs dreadfully\n",
      "involved.  She had had difficulties of every sort to contend with, and\n",
      "in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe\n",
      "rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs, had made her for\n",
      "the present a cripple.  She had come to Bath on that account, and was\n",
      "now in lodgings near the hot baths, living in a very humble way, unable\n",

      "Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from\n",

      "awkwardness and its emotion.  Twelve years were gone since they had\n",
      "parted, and each presented a somewhat different person from what the\n",
      "other had imagined.  Twelve years had changed Anne from the blooming,\n",
      "silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant little woman of\n",
      "seven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom, and with manners as\n",
      "consciously right as they were invariably gentle; and twelve years had\n",
      "transformed the fine-looking, well-grown Miss Hamilton, in all the glow\n",
      "of health and confidence of superiority, into a poor, infirm, helpless\n",
      "widow, receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour; but all\n",
      "that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away, and left\n",
      "only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and\n",
      "talking over old times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she\n",
      "had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse and be\n",
      "cheerful beyond her expectation.  Neither the dissipations of the\n",
      "past--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions of\n",
      "the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her\n",
      "heart or ruined her spirits.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness, and\n",
      "Anne's astonishment increased.  She could scarcely imagine a more\n",
      "cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith's.  She had been very fond\n",
      "of her husband:  she had buried him.  She had been used to affluence:\n",
      "it was gone.  She had no child to connect her with life and happiness\n",
      "again, no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs,\n",
      "no health to make all the rest supportable.  Her accommodations were\n",
      "limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom behind, with no\n",
      "possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance, which\n",
      "there was only one servant in the house to afford, and she never\n",
      "quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.  Yet, in spite\n",
      "of all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had moments only of\n",
      "languor and depression, to hours of occupation and enjoyment.  How\n",
      "could it be?  She watched, observed, reflected, and finally determined\n",
      "that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only.  A\n",
      "submissive spirit might be patient, a strong understanding would supply\n",
      "resolution, but here was something more; here was that elasticity of\n",
      "mind, that disposition to be comforted, that power of turning readily\n",
      "from evil to good, and of finding employment which carried her out of\n",
      "herself, which was from nature alone.  It was the choicest gift of\n",
      "Heaven; and Anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which,\n",
      "by a merciful appointment, it seems designed to counterbalance almost\n",
      "every other want.\n",
      "\n",
      "There had been a time, Mrs Smith told her, when her spirits had nearly\n",
      "failed.  She could not call herself an invalid now, compared with her\n",
      "state on first reaching Bath.  Then she had, indeed, been a pitiable\n",
      "object; for she had caught cold on the journey, and had hardly taken\n",
      "possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and\n",
      "suffering under severe and constant pain; and all this among strangers,\n",
      "with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse, and finances at\n",
      "that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense.  She\n",
      "had weathered it, however, and could truly say that it had done her\n",
      "good.  It had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be\n",
      "in good hands.  She had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or\n",
      "disinterested attachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her\n",
      "that her landlady had a character to preserve, and would not use her\n",
      "ill; and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister\n",
      "of her landlady, a nurse by profession, and who had always a home in\n",
      "that house when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to\n",
      "attend her.  \"And she,\" said Mrs Smith, \"besides nursing me most\n",
      "admirably, has really proved an invaluable acquaintance.  As soon as I\n",
      "could use my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great\n",
      "amusement; and she put me in the way of making these little\n",
      "thread-cases, pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so\n",
      "busy about, and which supply me with the means of doing a little good\n",
      "to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.  She had a\n",
      "large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those who can\n",
      "afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise.  She always takes\n",
      "the right time for applying.  Everybody's heart is open, you know, when\n",
      "they have recently escaped from severe pain, or are recovering the\n",
      "blessing of health, and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to\n",
      "speak.  She is a shrewd, intelligent, sensible woman.  Hers is a line\n",
      "for seeing human nature; and she has a fund of good sense and\n",
      "observation, which, as a companion, make her infinitely superior to\n",
      "thousands of those who having only received 'the best education in the\n",
      "world,' know nothing worth attending to.  Call it gossip, if you will,\n",
      "but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour's leisure to bestow on me, she is\n",
      "sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable:\n",
      "something that makes one know one's species better.  One likes to hear\n",
      "what is going on, to be au fait as to the newest modes of being\n",
      "trifling and silly.  To me, who live so much alone, her conversation, I\n",
      "assure you, is a treat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied, \"I can easily\n",
      "believe it.  Women of that class have great opportunities, and if they\n",
      "are intelligent may be well worth listening to.  Such varieties of\n",
      "human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!  And it is not\n",
      "merely in its follies, that they are well read; for they see it\n",
      "occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or\n",
      "affecting.  What instances must pass before them of ardent,\n",
      "disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude,\n",
      "patience, resignation:  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices\n",
      "that ennoble us most.  A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of\n",
      "volumes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Mrs Smith more doubtingly, \"sometimes it may, though I fear\n",
      "its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.  Here and\n",
      "there, human nature may be great in times of trial; but generally\n",
      "speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a\n",
      "sick chamber:  it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity\n",
      "and fortitude, that one hears of.  There is so little real friendship\n",
      "in the world! and unfortunately\" (speaking low and tremulously) \"there\n",
      "are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne saw the misery of such feelings.  The husband had not been what he\n",
      "ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made\n",
      "her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved.  It was but a\n",
      "passing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she shook it off, and soon\n",
      "added in a different tone--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present,\n",
      "will furnish much either to interest or edify me.  She is only nursing\n",
      "Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,\n",
      "fashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report\n",
      "but of lace and finery.  I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis,\n",
      "however.  She has plenty of money, and I intend she shall buy all the\n",

      "\n",
      "Anne had called several times on her friend, before the existence of\n",
      "such a person was known in Camden Place.  At last, it became necessary\n",
      "to speak of her. Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, returned one\n",
      "morning from Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple\n",
      "for the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that\n",
      "evening in Westgate Buildings.  She was not sorry for the excuse.  They\n",
      "were only asked, she was sure, because Lady Dalrymple being kept at\n",
      "home by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship which had\n",
      "been so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account with great\n",
      "alacrity--\"She was engaged to spend the evening with an old\n",
      "schoolfellow.\"  They were not much interested in anything relative to\n",
      "Anne; but still there were questions enough asked, to make it\n",
      "understood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth was\n",
      "disdainful, and Sir Walter severe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Westgate Buildings!\" said he, \"and who is Miss Anne Elliot to be\n",
      "visiting in Westgate Buildings?  A Mrs Smith.  A widow Mrs Smith; and\n",
      "who was her husband?  One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names are to\n",
      "be met with everywhere.  And what is her attraction?  That she is old\n",
      "and sickly.  Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot, you have the most\n",
      "extraordinary taste!  Everything that revolts other people, low\n",
      "company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations are inviting\n",
      "to you.  But surely you may put off this old lady till to-morrow:  she\n",
      "is not so near her end, I presume, but that she may hope to see another\n",
      "day.  What is her age?  Forty?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can put off\n",
      "my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time which will\n",

      "and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Mrs Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it\n",
      "advisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much, and did\n",
      "long to say a little in defence of her friend's not very dissimilar\n",
      "claims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect to her father\n",
      "prevented her.  She made no reply.  She left it to himself to\n",
      "recollect, that Mrs Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirty\n",

      "\n",
      "Anne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course she\n",
      "heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.  She had\n",
      "been the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had\n",
      "not only been quite at her ladyship's service themselves, but had\n",
      "actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others, and had\n",
      "been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot; and Mr\n",
      "Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early, and Lady\n",
      "Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait\n",
      "on her.  Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could\n",
      "supply from Lady Russell.  To her, its greatest interest must be, in\n",
      "having been very much talked of between her friend and Mr Elliot; in\n",
      "having been wished for, regretted, and at the same time honoured for\n",
      "staying away in such a cause.  Her kind, compassionate visits to this\n",
      "old schoolfellow, sick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr\n",
      "Elliot.  He thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her\n",
      "temper, manners, mind, a model of female excellence.  He could meet\n",
      "even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits; and Anne could not be\n",
      "given to understand so much by her friend, could not know herself to be\n",
      "so highly rated by a sensible man, without many of those agreeable\n",
      "sensations which her friend meant to create.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot.\n",
      "She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of his\n",
      "deserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which\n",
      "would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood, and\n",
      "leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing.  She\n",
      "would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the\n",
      "subject, she would venture on little more than hints of what might be\n",
      "hereafter, of a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness\n",
      "of the alliance, supposing such attachment to be real and returned.\n",
      "Anne heard her, and made no violent exclamations; she only smiled,\n",
      "blushed, and gently shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am no match-maker, as you well know,\" said Lady Russell, \"being much\n",
      "too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations.\n",
      "I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses\n",
      "to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him, I think there\n",

      "and, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings\n",
      "this picture excited.  For a few moments her imagination and her heart\n",

      "operation; and believing that, could Mr Elliot at that moment with\n",
      "propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed, in short, what Anne\n",
      "did not believe.  The same image of Mr Elliot speaking for himself\n",
      "brought Anne to composure again.  The charm of Kellynch and of \"Lady\n",

      "He certainly knew what was right, nor could she fix on any one article\n",
      "of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she would have been\n",
      "afraid to answer for his conduct.  She distrusted the past, if not the\n",
      "present.  The names which occasionally dropt of former associates, the\n",
      "allusions to former practices and pursuits, suggested suspicions not\n",
      "favourable of what he had been.  She saw that there had been bad\n",

      "been a period of his life (and probably not a short one) when he had\n",
      "been, at least, careless in all serious matters; and, though he might\n",
      "now think very differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of\n",

      "\"A letter from Uppercross Cottage, Sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! those letters are convenient passports.  They secure an\n",

      "\n",
      "Anne could listen no longer; she could not even have told how the poor\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"February 1st.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Anne,--I make no apology for my silence, because I know how\n",
      "little people think of letters in such a place as Bath.  You must be a\n",
      "great deal too happy to care for Uppercross, which, as you well know,\n",
      "affords little to write about.  We have had a very dull Christmas; Mr\n",
      "and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays.  I do\n",
      "not reckon the Hayters as anybody.  The holidays, however, are over at\n",
      "last:  I believe no children ever had such long ones.  I am sure I had\n",
      "not.  The house was cleared yesterday, except of the little Harvilles;\n",
      "but you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home.  Mrs\n",
      "Harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long.  I do not\n",
      "understand it.  They are not at all nice children, in my opinion; but\n",
      "Mrs Musgrove seems to like them quite as well, if not better, than her\n",
      "grandchildren.  What dreadful weather we have had!  It may not be felt\n",
      "in Bath, with your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some\n",
      "consequence.  I have not had a creature call on me since the second\n",
      "week in January, except Charles Hayter, who had been calling much\n",
      "oftener than was welcome.  Between ourselves, I think it a great pity\n",
      "Henrietta did not remain at Lyme as long as Louisa; it would have kept\n",
      "her a little out of his way.  The carriage is gone to-day, to bring\n",
      "Louisa and the Harvilles to-morrow.  We are not asked to dine with\n",
      "them, however, till the day after, Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her\n",
      "being fatigued by the journey, which is not very likely, considering\n",
      "the care that will be taken of her; and it would be much more\n",
      "convenient to me to dine there to-morrow.  I am glad you find Mr Elliot\n",
      "so agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted with him too; but I have\n",
      "my usual luck:  I am always out of the way when any thing desirable is\n",
      "going on; always the last of my family to be noticed.  What an immense\n",
      "time Mrs Clay has been staying with Elizabeth!  Does she never mean to\n",
      "go away?  But perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant, we might\n",
      "not be invited.  Let me know what you think of this.  I do not expect\n",
      "my children to be asked, you know.  I can leave them at the Great House\n",
      "very well, for a month or six weeks.  I have this moment heard that the\n",
      "Crofts are going to Bath almost immediately; they think the Admiral\n",
      "gouty.  Charles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the\n",
      "civility to give me any notice, or of offering to take anything.  I do\n",
      "not think they improve at all as neighbours.  We see nothing of them,\n",
      "and this is really an instance of gross inattention.  Charles joins me\n",
      "in love, and everything proper.  Yours affectionately,\n",

      "hope Bath will do him all the good he wants.  I shall be truly glad to\n",
      "have them back again.  Our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant\n",

      "safely, and in the evening we went to ask her how she did, when we were\n",
      "rather surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had\n",
      "been invited as well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the\n",
      "reason?  Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa, and\n",
      "not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr\n",
      "Musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her before she came\n",
      "away, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville.  True, upon\n",
      "my honour!  Are not you astonished?  I shall be surprised at least if\n",
      "you ever received a hint of it, for I never did.  Mrs Musgrove protests\n",
      "solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter.  We are all very well\n",
      "pleased, however, for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain\n",
      "Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter; and Mr Musgrove\n",
      "has written his consent, and Captain Benwick is expected to-day.  Mrs\n",
      "Harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister's\n",
      "account; but, however, Louisa is a great favourite with both.  Indeed,\n",
      "Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having\n",
      "nursed her.  Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say; but if\n",
      "you remember, I never thought him attached to Louisa; I never could see\n",
      "anything of it.  And this is the end, you see, of Captain Benwick's\n",
      "being supposed to be an admirer of yours.  How Charles could take such\n",
      "a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me.  I hope he\n",
      "will be more agreeable now.  Certainly not a great match for Louisa\n",
      "Musgrove, but a million times better than marrying among the Hayters.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary need not have feared her sister's being in any degree prepared for\n",
      "the news.  She had never in her life been more astonished.  Captain\n",
      "Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!  It was almost too wonderful for belief,\n",
      "and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room,\n",
      "preserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions of the\n",
      "moment.  Happily for her, they were not many.  Sir Walter wanted to\n",
      "know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses, and whether they\n",
      "were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss\n",
      "Elliot and himself to visit in; but had little curiosity beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is Mary?\" said Elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer, \"And\n",
      "pray what brings the Crofts to Bath?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They come on the Admiral's account.  He is thought to be gouty.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I suspect,\" said Sir Walter coolly, \"that Admiral Croft will be best\n",

      "venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "as cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours.  We\n",
      "had better leave the Crofts to find their own level.  There are several\n",
      "odd-looking men walking about here, who, I am told, are sailors.  The\n",
      "Crofts will associate with them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth's share of interest in the letter;\n",
      "when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention, in an\n",
      "enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove, and her fine little boys, Anne was\n",
      "at liberty.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her own room, she tried to comprehend it.  Well might Charles wonder\n",
      "how Captain Wentworth would feel!  Perhaps he had quitted the field,\n",
      "had given Louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her.\n",
      "She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything akin\n",
      "to ill usage between him and his friend.  She could not endure that\n",
      "such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!  The high-spirited, joyous-talking\n",
      "Louisa Musgrove, and the dejected, thinking, feeling, reading, Captain\n",
      "Benwick, seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other.\n",
      "Their minds most dissimilar!  Where could have been the attraction?\n",
      "The answer soon presented itself.  It had been in situation.  They had\n",
      "been thrown together several weeks; they had been living in the same\n",
      "small family party:  since Henrietta's coming away, they must have been\n",
      "depending almost entirely on each other, and Louisa, just recovering\n",
      "from illness, had been in an interesting state, and Captain Benwick was\n",
      "not inconsolable.  That was a point which Anne had not been able to\n",
      "avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as\n",
      "Mary, from the present course of events, they served only to confirm\n",
      "the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself.\n",
      "She did not mean, however, to derive much more from it to gratify her\n",
      "vanity, than Mary might have allowed.  She was persuaded that any\n",
      "tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for\n",
      "him would have received the same compliment.  He had an affectionate\n",
      "heart.  He must love somebody.\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw no reason against their being happy.  Louisa had fine naval\n",
      "fervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike.  He would\n",
      "gain cheerfulness, and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott\n",
      "and Lord Byron; nay, that was probably learnt already; of course they\n",
      "had fallen in love over poetry.  The idea of Louisa Musgrove turned\n",
      "into a person of literary taste, and sentimental reflection was\n",
      "amusing, but she had no doubt of its being so.  The day at Lyme, the\n",
      "fall from the Cobb, might influence her health, her nerves, her\n",
      "courage, her character to the end of her life, as thoroughly as it\n",
      "appeared to have influenced her fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had been\n",
      "sensible of Captain Wentworth's merits could be allowed to prefer\n",
      "another man, there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting\n",
      "wonder; and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly\n",
      "nothing to be regretted.  No, it was not regret which made Anne's heart\n",
      "beat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks when\n",
      "she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free.  She had some\n",
      "feelings which she was ashamed to investigate.  They were too much like\n",
      "joy, senseless joy!\n",
      "\n",
      "She longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place, it was\n",
      "evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them.  The visit of\n",
      "ceremony was paid and returned; and Louisa Musgrove was mentioned, and\n",
      "Captain Benwick, too, without even half a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street, perfectly\n",
      "to Sir Walter's satisfaction.  He was not at all ashamed of the\n",
      "acquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more about\n",
      "the Admiral, than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for, and\n",
      "considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form,\n",
      "and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure.  They brought\n",
      "with them their country habit of being almost always together.  He was\n",
      "ordered to walk to keep off the gout, and Mrs Croft seemed to go shares\n",
      "with him in everything, and to walk for her life to do him good.  Anne\n",
      "saw them wherever she went.  Lady Russell took her out in her carriage\n",
      "almost every morning, and she never failed to think of them, and never\n",
      "failed to see them.  Knowing their feelings as she did, it was a most\n",
      "attractive picture of happiness to her.  She always watched them as\n",
      "long as she could, delighted to fancy she understood what they might be\n",
      "talking of, as they walked along in happy independence, or equally\n",
      "delighted to see the Admiral's hearty shake of the hand when he\n",
      "encountered an old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation\n",
      "when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, Mrs Croft\n",
      "looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking\n",
      "herself; but it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days\n",
      "after the Croft's arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend, or\n",
      "her friend's carriage, in the lower part of the town, and return alone\n",
      "to Camden Place, and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good\n",
      "fortune to meet with the Admiral.  He was standing by himself at a\n",
      "printshop window, with his hands behind him, in earnest contemplation\n",
      "of some print, and she not only might have passed him unseen, but was\n",
      "obliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch his\n",
      "notice.  When he did perceive and acknowledge her, however, it was done\n",
      "with all his usual frankness and good humour.  \"Ha! is it you?  Thank\n",
      "you, thank you.  This is treating me like a friend.  Here I am, you\n",
      "see, staring at a picture.  I can never get by this shop without\n",
      "stopping.  But what a thing here is, by way of a boat!  Do look at it.\n",
      "Did you ever see the like?  What queer fellows your fine painters must\n",
      "be, to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless\n",
      "old cockleshell as that?  And yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it\n",
      "mightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks and\n",
      "mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment, which they\n",
      "certainly must be.  I wonder where that boat was built!\" (laughing\n",
      "heartily); \"I would not venture over a horsepond in it.  Well,\"\n",
      "(turning away), \"now, where are you bound?  Can I go anywhere for you,\n",

      "along.  There, take my arm; that's right; I do not feel comfortable if\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I have, presently.  But here comes a friend, Captain Brigden; I\n",

      "'How d'ye do?'  Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife.\n",
      "She, poor soul, is tied by the leg.  She has a blister on one of her\n",
      "heels, as large as a three-shilling piece.  If you look across the\n",
      "street, you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother.  Shabby\n",
      "fellows, both of them!  I am glad they are not on this side of the way.\n",
      "Sophy cannot bear them.  They played me a pitiful trick once: got away\n",
      "with some of my best men.  I will tell you the whole story another\n",
      "time.  There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson.  Look, he\n",
      "sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife.  Ah! the\n",
      "peace has come too soon for that younker.  Poor old Sir Archibald!  How\n",
      "do you like Bath, Miss Elliot?  It suits us very well.  We are always\n",
      "meeting with some old friend or other; the streets full of them every\n",
      "morning; sure to have plenty of chat; and then we get away from them\n",
      "all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings, and draw in our chairs, and\n",
      "are as snug as if we were at Kellynch, ay, or as we used to be even at\n",
      "North Yarmouth and Deal.  We do not like our lodgings here the worse, I\n",
      "can tell you, for putting us in mind of those we first had at North\n",
      "Yarmouth.  The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same\n",
      "way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When they were got a little farther, Anne ventured to press again for\n",
      "what he had to communicate.  She hoped when clear of Milsom Street to\n",
      "have her curiosity gratified; but she was still obliged to wait, for\n",
      "the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the\n",
      "greater space and quiet of Belmont; and as she was not really Mrs\n",
      "Croft, she must let him have his own way.  As soon as they were fairly\n",
      "ascending Belmont, he began--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you.  But first\n",
      "of all, you must tell me the name of the young lady I am going to talk\n",
      "about.  That young lady, you know, that we have all been so concerned\n",
      "for.  The Miss Musgrove, that all this has been happening to.  Her\n",
      "Christian name:  I always forget her Christian name.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really\n",
      "did; but now she could safely suggest the name of \"Louisa.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name.  I wish young ladies\n",
      "had not such a number of fine Christian names.  I should never be out\n",
      "if they were all Sophys, or something of that sort.  Well, this Miss\n",
      "Louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick.  He was\n",
      "courting her week after week.  The only wonder was, what they could be\n",
      "waiting for, till the business at Lyme came; then, indeed, it was clear\n",
      "enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right.  But even\n",
      "then there was something odd in their way of going on.  Instead of\n",
      "staying at Lyme, he went off to Plymouth, and then he went off to see\n",
      "Edward.  When we came back from Minehead he was gone down to Edward's,\n",
      "and there he has been ever since.  We have seen nothing of him since\n",
      "November.  Even Sophy could not understand it.  But now, the matter has\n",
      "taken the strangest turn of all; for this young lady, the same Miss\n",
      "Musgrove, instead of being to marry Frederick, is to marry James\n",
      "Benwick.  You know James Benwick.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Oh! yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against James Benwick.\n",
      "He is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are bad\n",
      "times for getting on, but he has not another fault that I know of.  An\n",
      "excellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active, zealous\n",
      "officer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps, for that\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Indeed you are mistaken there, sir; I should never augur want of\n",

      "There is something about Frederick more to our taste.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And the thing is certainly true.  It is not a mere bit of gossip.  We\n",
      "have it from Frederick himself.  His sister had a letter from him\n",

      "little below Milsom Street.  He was more obviously struck and confused\n",
      "by the sight of her than she had ever observed before; he looked quite\n",
      "red.  For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance, she felt\n",

      "recollect it.  He might be only passing through.  But it was more\n",
      "probable that he should be come to stay.  In that case, so liable as\n",

      "side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself.  This,\n",

      "and in a point no less essential than mind.  I regard Louisa Musgrove\n",
      "as a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in\n",
      "understanding, but Benwick is something more.  He is a clever man, a\n",
      "reading man; and I confess, that I do consider his attaching himself to\n",
      "her with some surprise.  Had it been the effect of gratitude, had he\n",
      "learnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him, it\n",
      "would have been another thing.  But I have no reason to suppose it so.\n",
      "It seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous,\n",
      "untaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me.  A man like him,\n",
      "in his situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!  Fanny\n",
      "Harville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her was\n",

      "spite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless slam\n",
      "of the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through, had\n",
      "distinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused, and\n",
      "beginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things in a\n",

      "\"About a fortnight.  I could not leave it till Louisa's doing well was\n",

      "be soon at peace.  It had been my doing, solely mine.  She would not\n",
      "have been obstinate if I had not been weak.  The country round Lyme is\n",
      "very fine.  I walked and rode a great deal; and the more I saw, the\n",
      "more I found to admire.\"\n",

      "involved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits!  I should have\n",
      "thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been strong disgust.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The last hours were certainly very painful,\" replied Anne; \"but when\n",
      "pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.  One does\n",
      "not love a place the less for having suffered in it, unless it has been\n",
      "all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was by no means the case at\n",
      "Lyme.  We were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours,\n",
      "and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment.  So much\n",
      "novelty and beauty! I have travelled so little, that every fresh place\n",
      "would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty at Lyme; and in\n",
      "short\" (with a faint blush at some recollections), \"altogether my\n",
      "impressions of the place are very agreeable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very party\n",
      "appeared for whom they were waiting.  \"Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple,\"\n",
      "was the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible with\n",
      "anxious elegance, Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet\n",
      "her.  Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, escorted by Mr Elliot and\n",
      "Colonel Wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant,\n",
      "advanced into the room.  The others joined them, and it was a group in\n",
      "which Anne found herself also necessarily included.  She was divided\n",
      "from Captain Wentworth.  Their interesting, almost too interesting\n",
      "conversation must be broken up for a time, but slight was the penance\n",
      "compared with the happiness which brought it on!  She had learnt, in\n",
      "the last ten minutes, more of his feelings towards Louisa, more of all\n",
      "his feelings than she dared to think of; and she gave herself up to the\n",
      "demands of the party, to the needful civilities of the moment, with\n",
      "exquisite, though agitated sensations.  She was in good humour with\n",
      "all.  She had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and\n",
      "kind to all, and to pity every one, as being less happy than herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back\n",
      "from the group, to be joined again by Captain Wentworth, she saw that\n",
      "he was gone.  She was just in time to see him turn into the Concert\n",
      "Room.  He was gone; he had disappeared, she felt a moment's regret.\n",
      "But \"they should meet again.  He would look for her, he would find her\n",
      "out before the evening were over, and at present, perhaps, it was as\n",
      "well to be asunder.  She was in need of a little interval for\n",
      "recollection.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon Lady Russell's appearance soon afterwards, the whole party was\n",
      "collected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves, and proceed\n",
      "into the Concert Room; and be of all the consequence in their power,\n",
      "draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers, and disturb as many people\n",
      "as they could.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very, very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in.\n",
      "Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking on the broad back\n",
      "of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her, had nothing to wish\n",
      "for which did not seem within her reach; and Anne--but it would be an\n",
      "insult to the nature of Anne's felicity, to draw any comparison between\n",
      "it and her sister's; the origin of one all selfish vanity, of the other\n",
      "all generous attachment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room.  Her\n",
      "happiness was from within.  Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed;\n",
      "but she knew nothing about it.  She was thinking only of the last half\n",
      "hour, and as they passed to their seats, her mind took a hasty range\n",
      "over it.  His choice of subjects, his expressions, and still more his\n",
      "manner and look, had been such as she could see in only one light.  His\n",
      "opinion of Louisa Musgrove's inferiority, an opinion which he had\n",
      "seemed solicitous to give, his wonder at Captain Benwick, his feelings\n",
      "as to a first, strong attachment; sentences begun which he could not\n",
      "finish, his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance,\n",
      "all, all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least; that\n",
      "anger, resentment, avoidance, were no more; and that they were\n",
      "succeeded, not merely by friendship and regard, but by the tenderness\n",
      "of the past.  Yes, some share of the tenderness of the past.  She could\n",
      "not contemplate the change as implying less.  He must love her.\n",
      "\n",
      "These were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied and\n",
      "flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation; and she\n",
      "passed along the room without having a glimpse of him, without even\n",
      "trying to discern him.  When their places were determined on, and they\n",
      "were all properly arranged, she looked round to see if he should happen\n",
      "to be in the same part of the room, but he was not; her eye could not\n",
      "reach him; and the concert being just opening, she must consent for a\n",
      "time to be happy in a humbler way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches: Anne\n",
      "was among those on the foremost, and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well,\n",
      "with the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis, as to have a seat by\n",
      "her.  Miss Elliot, surrounded by her cousins, and the principal object\n",
      "of Colonel Wallis's gallantry, was quite contented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne's mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the\n",
      "evening; it was just occupation enough:  she had feelings for the\n",
      "tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific, and patience\n",
      "for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better, at least\n",
      "during the first act.  Towards the close of it, in the interval\n",
      "succeeding an Italian song, she explained the words of the song to Mr\n",
      "Elliot.  They had a concert bill between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This,\" said she, \"is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the\n",
      "words, for certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be\n",
      "talked of, but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do not\n",
      "pretend to understand the language.  I am a very poor Italian scholar.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, I see you are.  I see you know nothing of the matter.  You\n",
      "have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these\n",
      "inverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear,\n",
      "comprehensible, elegant English.  You need not say anything more of\n",
      "your ignorance.  Here is complete proof.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I should be sorry to be\n",
      "examined by a real proficient.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long,\"\n",
      "replied he, \"without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot; and I do\n",
      "regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be\n",
      "aware of half her accomplishments, and too highly accomplished for\n",
      "modesty to be natural in any other woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For shame! for shame! this is too much flattery.  I forget what we are\n",
      "to have next,\" turning to the bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" said Mr Elliot, speaking low, \"I have had a longer\n",
      "acquaintance with your character than you are aware of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed!  How so?  You can have been acquainted with it only since I\n",
      "came to Bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my\n",
      "own family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I knew you by report long before you came to Bath.  I had heard you\n",
      "described by those who knew you intimately.  I have been acquainted\n",
      "with you by character many years.  Your person, your disposition,\n",
      "accomplishments, manner; they were all present to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise.  No\n",
      "one can withstand the charm of such a mystery.  To have been described\n",
      "long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people, is irresistible;\n",
      "and Anne was all curiosity.  She wondered, and questioned him eagerly;\n",
      "but in vain.  He delighted in being asked, but he would not tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now.  He would mention no\n",
      "names now; but such, he could assure her, had been the fact.  He had\n",
      "many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had\n",
      "inspired him with the highest idea of her merit, and excited the\n",
      "warmest curiosity to know her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of\n",
      "her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford, Captain Wentworth's\n",
      "brother.  He might have been in Mr Elliot's company, but she had not\n",
      "courage to ask the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The name of Anne Elliot,\" said he, \"has long had an interesting sound\n",
      "to me.  Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I\n",
      "dared, I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Such, she believed, were his words; but scarcely had she received their\n",
      "sound, than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind\n",
      "her, which rendered every thing else trivial.  Her father and Lady\n",
      "Dalrymple were speaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A well-looking man,\" said Sir Walter, \"a very well-looking man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A very fine young man indeed!\" said Lady Dalrymple.  \"More air than\n",
      "one often sees in Bath.  Irish, I dare say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I just know his name.  A bowing acquaintance.  Wentworth; Captain\n",
      "Wentworth of the navy.  His sister married my tenant in Somersetshire,\n",
      "the Croft, who rents Kellynch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Sir Walter had reached this point, Anne's eyes had caught the\n",
      "right direction, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing among a\n",
      "cluster of men at a little distance.  As her eyes fell on him, his\n",
      "seemed to be withdrawn from her.  It had that appearance.  It seemed as\n",
      "if she had been one moment too late; and as long as she dared observe,\n",
      "he did not look again:  but the performance was recommencing, and she\n",
      "was forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look\n",
      "straight forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she could give another glance, he had moved away.  He could not\n",
      "have come nearer to her if he would; she was so surrounded and shut in:\n",
      "but she would rather have caught his eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Elliot's speech, too, distressed her.  She had no longer any\n",
      "inclination to talk to him.  She wished him not so near her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first act was over.  Now she hoped for some beneficial change; and,\n",
      "after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them did\n",
      "decide on going in quest of tea.  Anne was one of the few who did not\n",
      "choose to move.  She remained in her seat, and so did Lady Russell; but\n",
      "she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot; and she did not mean,\n",
      "whatever she might feel on Lady Russell's account, to shrink from\n",
      "conversation with Captain Wentworth, if he gave her the opportunity.\n",
      "She was persuaded by Lady Russell's countenance that she had seen him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not come however.  Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a\n",
      "distance, but he never came.  The anxious interval wore away\n",
      "unproductively.  The others returned, the room filled again, benches\n",
      "were reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure or of\n",
      "penance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give delight or\n",
      "the gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed.  To Anne, it\n",
      "chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation.  She could not quit\n",
      "that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth once more, without\n",
      "the interchange of one friendly look.\n",
      "\n",
      "In re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of\n",
      "which was favourable for her.  Colonel Wallis declined sitting down\n",
      "again, and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in a\n",
      "manner not to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other\n",
      "removals, and a little scheming of her own,  Anne was enabled to place\n",
      "herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before, much\n",
      "more within reach of a passer-by.  She could not do so, without\n",
      "comparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles; but\n",
      "still she did it, and not with much happier effect; though by what\n",
      "seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next\n",
      "neighbours, she found herself at the very end of the bench before the\n",
      "concert closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain\n",
      "Wentworth was again in sight.  She saw him not far off.  He saw her\n",
      "too; yet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow\n",
      "degrees came at last near enough to speak to her.  She felt that\n",
      "something must be the matter.  The change was indubitable.  The\n",
      "difference between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon\n",
      "Room was strikingly great.  Why was it?  She thought of her father, of\n",
      "Lady Russell.  Could there have been any unpleasant glances?  He began\n",
      "by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain Wentworth of\n",
      "Uppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing; and in\n",
      "short, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over.  Anne\n",
      "replied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well, and yet in\n",
      "allowance for his feelings so pleasantly, that his countenance\n",
      "improved, and he replied again with almost a smile.  They talked for a\n",
      "few minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down towards the\n",
      "bench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying; when at that\n",
      "moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round.  It came\n",
      "from Mr Elliot.  He begged her pardon, but she must be applied to, to\n",
      "explain Italian again.  Miss Carteret was very anxious to have a\n",
      "general idea of what was next to be sung.  Anne could not refuse; but\n",
      "never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed; and\n",
      "when her own mistress again, when able to turn and look as she had done\n",
      "before, she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth, in a reserved\n",
      "yet hurried sort of farewell.  \"He must wish her good night; he was\n",
      "going; he should get home as fast as he could.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is not this song worth staying for?\" said Anne, suddenly struck by an\n",
      "idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No!\" he replied impressively, \"there is nothing worth my staying for;\"\n",
      "and he was gone directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jealousy of Mr Elliot!  It was the only intelligible motive.  Captain\n",
      "Wentworth jealous of her affection!  Could she have believed it a week\n",
      "ago; three hours ago!  For a moment the gratification was exquisite.\n",
      "But, alas! there were very different thoughts to succeed.  How was such\n",
      "jealousy to be quieted?  How was the truth to reach him?  How, in all\n",
      "the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations, would he\n",
      "ever learn of her real sentiments?  It was misery to think of Mr\n",
      "Elliot's attentions.  Their evil was incalculable.\n",

      "almost a first object.\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt a great deal of good-will towards him.  In spite of the\n",

      "\"Oh! you saw enough for your own amusement.  I can understand.  There\n",
      "is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd, and this\n",
      "you had.  You were a large party in yourselves, and you wanted nothing\n",
      "beyond.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I ought to have looked about me more,\" said Anne, conscious while\n",
      "she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about, that\n",
      "the object only had been deficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no; you were better employed.  You need not tell me that you had a\n",
      "pleasant evening.  I see it in your eye.  I perfectly see how the hours\n",
      "passed:  that you had always something agreeable to listen to.  In the\n",
      "intervals of the concert it was conversation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne half smiled and said, \"Do you see that in my eye?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I do.  Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in\n",
      "company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in\n",
      "the world, the person who interests you at this present time more than\n",
      "all the rest of the world put together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A blush overspread Anne's cheeks.  She could say nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And such being the case,\" continued Mrs Smith, after a short pause, \"I\n",
      "hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness in coming to\n",
      "me this morning.  It is really very good of you to come and sit with\n",
      "me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne heard nothing of this.  She was still in the astonishment and\n",
      "confusion excited by her friend's penetration, unable to imagine how\n",
      "any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her.  After another\n",
      "short silence--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pray,\" said Mrs Smith, \"is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with\n",
      "me?  Does he know that I am in Bath?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr Elliot!\" repeated Anne, looking up surprised.  A moment's\n",
      "reflection shewed her the mistake she had been under.  She caught it\n",
      "instantaneously; and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety,\n",
      "soon added, more composedly, \"Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have been a good deal acquainted with him,\" replied Mrs Smith,\n",
      "gravely, \"but it seems worn out now.  It is a great while since we met.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was not at all aware of this.  You never mentioned it before.  Had I\n",
      "known it, I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To confess the truth,\" said Mrs Smith, assuming her usual air of\n",
      "cheerfulness, \"that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have.  I want\n",
      "you to talk about me to Mr Elliot.  I want your interest with him.  He\n",
      "can be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness,\n",
      "my dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object to yourself, of course it is\n",
      "done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness to\n",
      "be of even the slightest use to you,\" replied Anne; \"but I suspect that\n",
      "you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot, a greater\n",
      "right to influence him, than is really the case.  I am sure you have,\n",
      "somehow or other, imbibed such a notion.  You must consider me only as\n",
      "Mr Elliot's relation.  If in that light there is anything which you\n",
      "suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him, I beg you would not\n",
      "hesitate to employ me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have been a little premature, I perceive; I beg your pardon.  I\n",
      "ought to have waited for official information.  But now, my dear Miss\n",
      "Elliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when I may speak.\n",
      "Next week?  To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it all\n",
      "settled, and build my own selfish schemes on Mr Elliot's good fortune.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" replied Anne, \"nor next week, nor next, nor next.  I assure you\n",
      "that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week.\n",
      "I am not going to marry Mr Elliot.  I should like to know why you\n",
      "imagine I am?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Smith looked at her again, looked earnestly, smiled, shook her\n",
      "head, and exclaimed--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, how I do wish I understood you!  How I do wish I knew what you\n",
      "were at!  I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel, when\n",
      "the right moment occurs.  Till it does come, you know, we women never\n",
      "mean to have anybody.  It is a thing of course among us, that every man\n",
      "is refused, till he offers.  But why should you be cruel?  Let me plead\n",
      "for my--present friend I cannot call him, but for my former friend.\n",
      "Where can you look for a more suitable match?  Where could you expect a\n",
      "more gentlemanlike, agreeable man?  Let me recommend Mr Elliot.  I am\n",
      "sure you hear nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis; and who can\n",
      "know him better than Colonel Wallis?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Mrs Smith, Mr Elliot's wife has not been dead much above half\n",
      "a year.  He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any\n",
      "one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! if these are your only objections,\" cried Mrs Smith, archly, \"Mr\n",
      "Elliot is safe, and I shall give myself no more trouble about him.  Do\n",
      "not forget me when you are married, that's all.  Let him know me to be\n",
      "a friend of yours, and then he will think little of the trouble\n",
      "required, which it is very natural for him now, with so many affairs\n",
      "and engagements of his own, to avoid and get rid of as he can; very\n",
      "natural, perhaps.  Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.  Of\n",
      "course, he cannot be aware of the importance to me.  Well, my dear Miss\n",
      "Elliot, I hope and trust you will be very happy.  Mr Elliot has sense\n",
      "to understand the value of such a woman.  Your peace will not be\n",
      "shipwrecked as mine has been.  You are safe in all worldly matters, and\n",
      "safe in his character.  He will not be led astray; he will not be\n",
      "misled by others to his ruin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Anne, \"I can readily believe all that of my cousin.  He\n",
      "seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open to dangerous\n",
      "impressions.  I consider him with great respect.  I have no reason,\n",
      "from any thing that has fallen within my observation, to do otherwise.\n",
      "But I have not known him long; and he is not a man, I think, to be\n",
      "known intimately soon.  Will not this manner of speaking of him, Mrs\n",
      "Smith, convince you that he is nothing to me?  Surely this must be calm\n",
      "enough.  And, upon my word, he is nothing to me.  Should he ever\n",
      "propose to me (which I have very little reason to imagine he has any\n",
      "thought of doing), I shall not accept him.  I assure you I shall not.\n",
      "I assure you, Mr Elliot had not the share which you have been\n",
      "supposing, in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford:\n",
      "not Mr Elliot; it is not Mr Elliot that--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much;\n",
      "but less would hardly have been sufficient.  Mrs Smith would hardly\n",
      "have believed so soon in Mr Elliot's failure, but from the perception\n",
      "of there being a somebody else.  As it was, she instantly submitted,\n",
      "and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne, eager to\n",
      "escape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs Smith should have\n",
      "fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot; where she could have received the\n",
      "idea, or from whom she could have heard it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do tell me how it first came into your head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It first came into my head,\" replied Mrs Smith, \"upon finding how much\n",
      "you were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the\n",
      "world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you; and you\n",
      "may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in\n",
      "the same way.  But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And has it indeed been spoken of?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called\n",
      "yesterday?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No.  Was not it Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid?  I observed no one\n",
      "in particular.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was my friend Mrs Rooke; Nurse Rooke; who, by-the-bye, had a great\n",
      "curiosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way to let you in.\n",
      "She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday; and she it was\n",
      "who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot.  She had had it from Mrs\n",
      "Wallis herself, which did not seem bad authority.  She sat an hour with\n",
      "me on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history.\" \"The whole\n",
      "history,\" repeated Anne, laughing.  \"She could not make a very long\n",
      "history, I think, of one such little article of unfounded news.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Smith said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But,\" continued Anne, presently, \"though there is no truth in my\n",
      "having this claim on Mr Elliot, I should be extremely happy to be of\n",
      "use to you in any way that I could.  Shall I mention to him your being\n",
      "in Bath?  Shall I take any message?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I thank you:  no, certainly not.  In the warmth of the moment, and\n",
      "under a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured to\n",
      "interest you in some circumstances; but not now.  No, I thank you, I\n",
      "have nothing to trouble you with.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not before he was married, I suppose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; he was not married when I knew him first.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And--were you much acquainted?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Intimately.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed!  Then do tell me what he was at that time of life.  I have a\n",
      "great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man.  Was he\n",
      "at all such as he appears now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years,\" was Mrs Smith's answer,\n",
      "given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther;\n",
      "and Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity.\n",
      "They were both silent:  Mrs Smith very thoughtful.  At last--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot,\" she cried, in her natural\n",
      "tone of cordiality, \"I beg your pardon for the short answers I have\n",
      "been giving you, but I have been uncertain what I ought to do.  I have\n",
      "been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you.  There\n",
      "were many things to be taken into the account.  One hates to be\n",
      "officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief.  Even the\n",
      "smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving, though there may\n",
      "be nothing durable beneath.  However, I have determined; I think I am\n",
      "right; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot's real\n",
      "character.  Though I fully believe that, at present, you have not the\n",
      "smallest intention of accepting him, there is no saying what may\n",
      "happen.  You might, some time or other, be differently affected towards\n",
      "him.  Hear the truth, therefore, now, while you are unprejudiced.  Mr\n",
      "Elliot is a man without heart or conscience; a designing, wary,\n",
      "cold-blooded being, who thinks only of himself; whom for his own\n",
      "interest or ease, would be guilty of any cruelty, or any treachery,\n",
      "that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character.  He\n",
      "has no feeling for others.  Those whom he has been the chief cause of\n",
      "leading into ruin, he can neglect and desert without the smallest\n",
      "compunction.  He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of\n",
      "justice or compassion.  Oh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne's astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause, and\n",
      "in a calmer manner, she added,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My expressions startle you.  You must allow for an injured, angry\n",
      "woman.  But I will try to command myself.  I will not abuse him.  I\n",
      "will only tell you what I have found him.  Facts shall speak.  He was\n",
      "the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him, and\n",
      "thought him as good as himself.  The intimacy had been formed before\n",
      "our marriage.  I found them most intimate friends; and I, too, became\n",
      "excessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained the highest opinion\n",
      "of him.  At nineteen, you know, one does not think very seriously; but\n",
      "Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others, and much more\n",
      "agreeable than most others, and we were almost always together.  We\n",
      "were principally in town, living in very good style.  He was then the\n",
      "inferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one; he had chambers in\n",
      "the Temple, and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance\n",
      "of a gentleman.  He had always a home with us whenever he chose it; he\n",
      "was always welcome; he was like a brother.  My poor Charles, who had\n",
      "the finest, most generous spirit in the world, would have divided his\n",
      "last farthing with him; and I know that his purse was open to him; I\n",
      "know that he often assisted him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot's life,\" said\n",
      "Anne, \"which has always excited my particular curiosity.  It must have\n",
      "been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister.\n",
      "I never knew him myself; I only heard of him; but there was a something\n",
      "in his conduct then, with regard to my father and sister, and\n",
      "afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage, which I never could\n",
      "quite reconcile with present times.  It seemed to announce a different\n",
      "sort of man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know it all, I know it all,\" cried Mrs Smith.  \"He had been\n",
      "introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with\n",
      "him, but I heard him speak of them for ever.  I know he was invited and\n",
      "encouraged, and I know he did not choose to go.  I can satisfy you,\n",
      "perhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to his\n",
      "marriage, I knew all about it at the time.  I was privy to all the fors\n",
      "and againsts; I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans;\n",
      "and though I did not know his wife previously, her inferior situation\n",
      "in society, indeed, rendered that impossible, yet I knew her all her\n",
      "life afterwards, or at least till within the last two years of her\n",
      "life, and can answer any question you may wish to put.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay,\" said Anne, \"I have no particular enquiry to make about her.  I\n",
      "have always understood they were not a happy couple.  But I should like\n",
      "to know why, at that time of his life, he should slight my father's\n",
      "acquaintance as he did.  My father was certainly disposed to take very\n",
      "kind and proper notice of him.  Why did Mr Elliot draw back?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr Elliot,\" replied Mrs Smith, \"at that period of his life, had one\n",
      "object in view:  to make his fortune, and by a rather quicker process\n",
      "than the law.  He was determined to make it by marriage.  He was\n",
      "determined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage; and I\n",
      "know it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course I cannot\n",
      "decide), that your father and sister, in their civilities and\n",
      "invitations, were designing a match between the heir and the young\n",
      "lady, and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his\n",
      "ideas of wealth and independence.  That was his motive for drawing\n",
      "back, I can assure you.  He told me the whole story.  He had no\n",
      "concealments with me.  It was curious, that having just left you behind\n",
      "me in Bath, my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be\n",
      "your cousin; and that, through him, I should be continually hearing of\n",
      "your father and sister.  He described one Miss Elliot, and I thought\n",
      "very affectionately of the other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" cried Anne, struck by a sudden idea, \"you sometimes spoke of\n",
      "me to Mr Elliot?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure I did; very often.  I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot,\n",
      "and vouch for your being a very different creature from--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She checked herself just in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night,\" cried\n",
      "Anne.  \"This explains it.  I found he had been used to hear of me.  I\n",
      "could not comprehend how.  What wild imaginations one forms where dear\n",
      "self is concerned!  How sure to be mistaken!  But I beg your pardon; I\n",
      "have interrupted you.  Mr Elliot married then completely for money?\n",
      "The circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes to his\n",
      "character.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Smith hesitated a little here.  \"Oh! those things are too common.\n",
      "When one lives in the world, a man or woman's marrying for money is too\n",
      "common to strike one as it ought.  I was very young, and associated\n",
      "only with the young, and we were a thoughtless, gay set, without any\n",
      "strict rules of conduct.  We lived for enjoyment.  I think differently\n",
      "now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions; but at\n",
      "that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliot\n",
      "was doing.  'To do the best for himself,' passed as a duty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But was not she a very low woman?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; which I objected to, but he would not regard.  Money, money, was\n",
      "all that he wanted.  Her father was a grazier, her grandfather had been\n",
      "a butcher, but that was all nothing.  She was a fine woman, had had a\n",
      "decent education, was brought forward by some cousins, thrown by chance\n",
      "into Mr Elliot's company, and fell in love with him; and not a\n",
      "difficulty or a scruple was there on his side, with respect to her\n",
      "birth.  All his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount\n",
      "of her fortune, before he committed himself.  Depend upon it, whatever\n",
      "esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation in life now, as a young\n",
      "man he had not the smallest value for it.  His chance for the Kellynch\n",
      "estate was something, but all the honour of the family he held as cheap\n",
      "as dirt.  I have often heard him declare, that if baronetcies were\n",
      "saleable, anybody should have his for fifty pounds, arms and motto,\n",
      "name and livery included; but I will not pretend to repeat half that I\n",
      "used to hear him say on that subject.  It would not be fair; and yet\n",
      "you ought to have proof, for what is all this but assertion, and you\n",
      "shall have proof.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, my dear Mrs Smith, I want none,\" cried Anne.  \"You have\n",
      "asserted nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some\n",
      "years ago.  This is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to\n",
      "hear and believe.  I am more curious to know why he should be so\n",
      "different now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for\n",
      "Mary; stay:  I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of\n",
      "going yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box\n",
      "which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she was\n",
      "desired.  The box was brought and placed before her, and Mrs Smith,\n",
      "sighing over it as she unlocked it, said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband; a small\n",
      "portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him.  The letter I\n",
      "am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage,\n",
      "and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.  But he was\n",
      "careless and immethodical, like other men, about those things; and when\n",
      "I came to examine his papers, I found it with others still more\n",
      "trivial, from different people scattered here and there, while many\n",
      "letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed.  Here it\n",
      "is; I would not burn it, because being even then very little satisfied\n",
      "with Mr Elliot, I was determined to preserve every document of former\n",
      "intimacy.  I have now another motive for being glad that I can produce\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the letter, directed to \"Charles Smith, Esq. Tunbridge Wells,\"\n",
      "and dated from London, as far back as July, 1803:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear Smith,--I have received yours.  Your kindness almost overpowers\n",
      "me.  I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but I\n",
      "have lived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like\n",
      "it.  At present, believe me, I have no need of your services, being in\n",
      "cash again.  Give me joy:  I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss.  They\n",
      "are gone back to Kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them this\n",
      "summer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor, to tell\n",
      "me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer.  The baronet,\n",
      "nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again; he is quite fool enough.\n",
      "If he does, however, they will leave me in peace, which may be a decent\n",
      "equivalent  for the reversion.  He is worse than last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I had any name but Elliot.  I am sick of it.  The name of\n",
      "Walter I can drop, thank God! and I desire you will never insult me\n",
      "with my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life, to be only\n",
      "yours truly,--Wm. Elliot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow; and Mrs\n",
      "Smith, observing the high colour in her face, said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The language, I know, is highly disrespectful.  Though I have forgot\n",
      "the exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning.\n",
      "But it shows you the man.  Mark his professions to my poor husband.\n",
      "Can any thing be stronger?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of\n",
      "finding such words applied to her father.  She was obliged to recollect\n",
      "that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour, that\n",
      "no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies, that no\n",
      "private correspondence could bear the eye of others, before she could\n",
      "recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been\n",
      "meditating over, and say--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you.  This is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing you\n",
      "were saying.  But why be acquainted with us now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can explain this too,\" cried Mrs Smith, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you really?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.  I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago, and I\n",
      "will shew him as he is now.  I cannot produce written proof again, but\n",
      "I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what he is\n",
      "now wanting, and what he is now doing.  He is no hypocrite now.  He\n",
      "truly wants to marry you.  His present attentions to your family are\n",
      "very sincere:  quite from the heart.  I will give you my authority: his\n",
      "friend Colonel Wallis.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Colonel Wallis! you are acquainted with him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No.  It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that; it\n",
      "takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence.  The stream is as good\n",
      "as at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily\n",
      "moved away.  Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis of his\n",
      "views on you, which said Colonel Wallis, I imagine to be, in himself, a\n",
      "sensible, careful, discerning sort of character; but Colonel Wallis has\n",
      "a very pretty silly wife, to whom he tells things which he had better\n",
      "not, and he repeats it all to her.  She in the overflowing spirits of\n",
      "her recovery, repeats it all to her nurse; and the nurse  knowing my\n",
      "acquaintance with you, very naturally brings it all to me.  On Monday\n",
      "evening, my good friend Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of\n",
      "Marlborough Buildings.  When I talked of a whole history, therefore,\n",
      "you see I was not romancing so much as you supposed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Mrs Smith, your authority is deficient.  This will not do.  Mr\n",
      "Elliot's having any views on me will not in the least account for the\n",
      "efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father.  That was all\n",
      "prior to my coming to Bath.  I found them on the most friendly terms\n",
      "when I arrived.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, Mrs Smith, we must not expect to get real information in such\n",
      "a line.  Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so\n",
      "many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another, can\n",
      "hardly have much truth left.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only give me a hearing.  You will soon be able to judge of the general\n",
      "credit due, by listening to some particulars which you can yourself\n",
      "immediately contradict or confirm.  Nobody supposes that you were his\n",
      "first inducement.  He had seen you indeed, before he came to Bath, and\n",
      "admired you, but without knowing it to be you.  So says my historian,\n",
      "at least.  Is this true?  Did he see you last summer or autumn,\n",
      "'somewhere down in the west,' to use her own words, without knowing it\n",
      "to be you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He certainly did.  So far it is very true.  At Lyme.  I happened to be\n",
      "at Lyme.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" continued Mrs Smith, triumphantly, \"grant my friend the credit\n",
      "due to the establishment of the first point asserted.  He saw you then\n",
      "at Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet\n",
      "with you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot, and from that\n",
      "moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive in his visits there.  But\n",
      "there was another, and an earlier, which I will now explain.  If there\n",
      "is anything in my story which you know to be either false or\n",
      "improbable, stop me.  My account states, that your sister's friend, the\n",
      "lady now staying with you, whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath\n",
      "with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September (in short when\n",
      "they first came themselves), and has been staying there ever since;\n",
      "that she is a clever, insinuating, handsome woman, poor and plausible,\n",
      "and altogether such in situation and manner, as to give a general idea,\n",
      "among Sir Walter's acquaintance, of her meaning to be Lady Elliot, and\n",
      "as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to\n",
      "the danger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Mrs Smith paused a moment; but Anne had not a word to say, and she\n",
      "continued--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family,\n",
      "long before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon\n",
      "your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then visit\n",
      "in Camden Place; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest in\n",
      "watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to Bath\n",
      "for a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas,\n",
      "Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things, and\n",
      "the reports beginning to prevail.  Now you are to understand, that time\n",
      "had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot's opinions as to the\n",
      "value of a baronetcy.  Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a\n",
      "completely altered man.  Having long had as much money as he could\n",
      "spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence, he has\n",
      "been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is\n",
      "heir to.  I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased, but it\n",
      "is now a confirmed feeling.  He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir\n",
      "William.  You may guess, therefore, that the news he heard from his\n",
      "friend could not be very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced;\n",
      "the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of\n",
      "fixing himself here for a time, with the view of renewing his former\n",
      "acquaintance, and recovering such a footing in the family as might give\n",
      "him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of\n",
      "circumventing the lady if he found it material.  This was agreed upon\n",
      "between the two friends as the only thing to be done; and Colonel\n",
      "Wallis was to assist in every way that he could.  He was to be\n",
      "introduced, and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced, and everybody was to\n",
      "be introduced.  Mr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was\n",
      "forgiven, as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it\n",
      "was his constant object, and his only object (till your arrival added\n",
      "another motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay.  He omitted no\n",
      "opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way, called at\n",
      "all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject.  You can\n",
      "imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide, perhaps, may\n",
      "recollect what you have seen him do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Anne, \"you tell me nothing which does not accord with what\n",
      "I have known, or could imagine.  There is always something offensive in\n",
      "the details of cunning.  The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity\n",
      "must ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which really surprises\n",
      "me.  I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr\n",
      "Elliot, who would have difficulty in believing it; but I have never\n",
      "been satisfied.  I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct\n",
      "than appeared.  I should like to know his present opinion, as to the\n",
      "probability of the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers\n",
      "the danger to be lessening or not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lessening, I understand,\" replied Mrs Smith.  \"He thinks Mrs Clay\n",
      "afraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring to\n",
      "proceed as she might do in his absence.  But since he must be absent\n",
      "some time or other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while\n",
      "she holds her present influence.  Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea, as\n",
      "nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles when\n",
      "you and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay.  A\n",
      "scheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis's understanding, by all accounts; but my\n",
      "sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it.  'Why, to be sure,\n",
      "ma'am,' said she, 'it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.'\n",
      "And, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart, is a\n",
      "very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter's making a second match.  She must\n",
      "be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know; and (since self\n",
      "will intrude) who can say that she may not have some flying visions of\n",
      "attending the next Lady Elliot, through Mrs Wallis's recommendation?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very glad to know all this,\" said Anne, after a little\n",
      "thoughtfulness.  \"It will be more painful to me in some respects to be\n",
      "in company with him, but I shall know better what to do.  My line of\n",
      "conduct will be more direct.  Mr Elliot is evidently a disingenuous,\n",
      "artificial, worldly man, who has never had any better principle to\n",
      "guide him than selfishness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mr Elliot was not done with.  Mrs Smith had been carried away from\n",
      "her first direction, and Anne had forgotten, in the interest of her own\n",
      "family concerns, how much had been originally implied against him; but\n",
      "her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints,\n",
      "and she listened to a recital which, if it did not perfectly justify\n",
      "the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith, proved him to have been very\n",
      "unfeeling in his conduct towards her; very deficient both in justice\n",
      "and compassion.\n",
      "\n",
      "She learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr\n",
      "Elliot's marriage) they had been as before always together, and Mr\n",
      "Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune.  Mrs\n",
      "Smith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender of\n",
      "throwing any on her husband; but Anne could collect that their income\n",
      "had never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first\n",
      "there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance.  From\n",
      "his wife's account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been a man\n",
      "of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong\n",
      "understanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him,\n",
      "led by him, and probably despised by him.  Mr Elliot, raised by his\n",
      "marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification of\n",
      "pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself,\n",
      "(for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man), and\n",
      "beginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself to\n",
      "be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend's\n",
      "probable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and\n",
      "encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Smiths\n",
      "accordingly had been ruined.\n",
      "\n",
      "The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of\n",
      "it.  They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the\n",
      "friendship of their friends, and to prove that Mr Elliot's had better\n",
      "not be tried; but it was not till his death that the wretched state of\n",
      "his affairs was fully known.  With a confidence in Mr Elliot's regard,\n",
      "more creditable to his feelings than his judgement, Mr Smith had\n",
      "appointed him the executor of his will; but Mr Elliot would not act,\n",
      "and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her,\n",
      "in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been\n",
      "such as could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to\n",
      "without corresponding indignation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to urgent\n",
      "applications from Mrs Smith, which all breathed the same stern\n",
      "resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and, under a cold\n",
      "civility, the same hard-hearted indifference to any of the evils it\n",
      "might bring on her.  It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and\n",
      "inhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments, that no flagrant open crime\n",
      "could have been worse.  She had a great deal to listen to; all the\n",
      "particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae of distress upon\n",
      "distress, which in former conversations had been merely hinted at, were\n",
      "dwelt on now with a natural indulgence.  Anne could perfectly\n",
      "comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only the more inclined to\n",
      "wonder at the composure of her friend's usual state of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of\n",
      "particular irritation.  She had good reason to believe that some\n",
      "property of her husband in the West Indies, which had been for many\n",
      "years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own\n",
      "incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures; and this\n",
      "property, though not large, would be enough to make her comparatively\n",
      "rich.  But there was nobody to stir in it.  Mr Elliot would do nothing,\n",
      "and she could do nothing herself, equally disabled from personal\n",
      "exertion by her state of bodily weakness, and from employing others by\n",
      "her want of money.  She had no natural connexions to assist her even\n",
      "with their counsel, and she could not afford to purchase the assistance\n",
      "of the law.  This was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means.\n",
      "To feel that she ought to be in better circumstances, that a little\n",
      "trouble in the right place might do it, and to fear that delay might be\n",
      "even weakening her claims, was hard to bear.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne's good offices\n",
      "with Mr Elliot.  She had previously, in the anticipation of their\n",
      "marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it; but on\n",
      "being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature, since\n",
      "he did not even know her to be in Bath, it immediately occurred, that\n",
      "something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he\n",
      "loved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne's feelings,\n",
      "as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot's character would allow,\n",
      "when Anne's refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of\n",
      "everything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope of\n",
      "succeeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least the\n",
      "comfort of telling the whole story her own way.\n",
      "\n",
      "After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot, Anne could not\n",
      "but express some surprise at Mrs Smith's having spoken of him so\n",
      "favourably in the beginning of their conversation.  \"She had seemed to\n",
      "recommend and praise him!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear,\" was Mrs Smith's reply, \"there was nothing else to be done.\n",
      "I considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet have\n",
      "made the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him, than if he\n",
      "had been your husband.  My heart bled for you, as I talked of\n",
      "happiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable, and with such a\n",
      "woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless.  He was very unkind to\n",
      "his first wife.  They were wretched together.  But she was too ignorant\n",
      "and giddy for respect, and he had never loved her.  I was willing to\n",
      "hope that you must fare better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having\n",
      "been induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea of the\n",
      "misery which must have followed.  It was just possible that she might\n",
      "have been persuaded by Lady Russell!  And under such a supposition,\n",
      "which would have been most miserable, when time had disclosed all, too\n",
      "late?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived;\n",
      "and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference,\n",
      "which carried them through the greater part of the morning, was, that\n",
      "Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative\n",
      "to Mrs Smith, in which his conduct was involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 22\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne went home to think over all that she had heard.  In one point, her\n",
      "feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot.  There was no\n",
      "longer anything of tenderness due to him.  He stood as opposed to\n",
      "Captain Wentworth, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness; and the evil\n",
      "of his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief he might have\n",
      "done, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed.  Pity\n",
      "for him was all over.  But this was the only point of relief.  In every\n",
      "other respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward, she saw\n",
      "more to distrust and to apprehend.  She was concerned for the\n",
      "disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling; for the\n",
      "mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister, and\n",
      "had all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing how to\n",
      "avert any one of them.  She was most thankful for her own knowledge of\n",
      "him.  She had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not\n",
      "slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith, but here was a reward indeed\n",
      "springing from it!  Mrs Smith had been able to tell her what no one\n",
      "else could have done.  Could the knowledge have been extended through\n",
      "her family?  But this was a vain idea.  She must talk to Lady Russell,\n",
      "tell her, consult with her, and having done her best, wait the event\n",
      "with as much composure as possible; and after all, her greatest want of\n",
      "composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be\n",
      "opened to Lady Russell; in that flow of anxieties and fears which must\n",
      "be all to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She found, on reaching home, that she had, as she intended, escaped\n",
      "seeing Mr Elliot; that he had called and paid them a long morning\n",
      "visit; but hardly had she congratulated herself, and felt safe, when\n",
      "she heard that he was coming again in the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had not the smallest intention of asking him,\" said Elizabeth, with\n",
      "affected carelessness, \"but he gave so many hints; so Mrs Clay says, at\n",
      "least.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, I do say it.  I never saw anybody in my life spell harder for\n",
      "an invitation.  Poor man!  I was really in pain for him; for your\n",
      "hard-hearted sister, Miss Anne, seems bent on cruelty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I have been rather too much used to the game to\n",
      "be soon overcome by a gentleman's hints.  However, when I found how\n",
      "excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this\n",
      "morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit an\n",
      "opportunity of bringing him and Sir Walter together.  They appear to so\n",
      "much advantage in company with each other.  Each behaving so\n",
      "pleasantly.  Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite delightful!\" cried Mrs Clay, not daring, however, to turn her\n",
      "eyes towards Anne.  \"Exactly like father and son!  Dear Miss Elliot,\n",
      "may I not say father and son?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! I lay no embargo on any body's words.  If you will have such\n",
      "ideas!  But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his attentions\n",
      "being beyond those of other men.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Miss Elliot!\" exclaimed Mrs Clay, lifting her hands and eyes,\n",
      "and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, my dear Penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him.  I did\n",
      "invite him, you know.  I sent him away with smiles.  When I found he\n",
      "was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day\n",
      "to-morrow, I had compassion on him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew such\n",
      "pleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival of\n",
      "the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her\n",
      "prime object.  It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate the sight\n",
      "of Mr Elliot; and yet she could assume a most obliging, placid look,\n",
      "and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting\n",
      "herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have done\n",
      "otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the\n",
      "room; and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her.  She had\n",
      "been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere, but\n",
      "now she saw insincerity in everything.  His attentive deference to her\n",
      "father, contrasted with his former language, was odious; and when she\n",
      "thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith, she could hardly bear\n",
      "the sight of his present smiles and mildness, or the sound of his\n",
      "artificial good sentiments.\n",
      "\n",
      "She meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a\n",
      "remonstrance on his side.  It was a great object to her to escape all\n",
      "enquiry or eclat; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to\n",
      "him as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace, as\n",
      "quietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had\n",
      "been gradually led along.  She was accordingly more guarded, and more\n",
      "cool, than she had been the night before.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could\n",
      "have heard her formerly praised; wanted very much to be gratified by\n",
      "more solicitation; but the charm was broken: he found that the heat and\n",
      "animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousin's\n",
      "vanity; he found, at least, that it was not to be done now, by any of\n",
      "those attempts which he could hazard among the too-commanding claims of\n",
      "the others.  He little surmised that it was a subject acting now\n",
      "exactly against his interest, bringing immediately to her thoughts all\n",
      "those parts of his conduct which were least excusable.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of\n",
      "Bath the next morning, going early, and that he would be gone the\n",
      "greater part of two days.  He was invited again to Camden Place the\n",
      "very evening of his return; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his\n",
      "absence was certain.  It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be\n",
      "always before her; but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their\n",
      "party, seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort.  It\n",
      "was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on\n",
      "her father and Elizabeth; to consider the various sources of\n",
      "mortification preparing for them!  Mrs Clay's selfishness was not so\n",
      "complicate nor so revolting as his; and Anne would have compounded for\n",
      "the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr Elliot's\n",
      "subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell, and\n",
      "accomplish the necessary communication; and she would have gone\n",
      "directly after breakfast, but that Mrs Clay was also going out on some\n",
      "obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble, which determined her to\n",
      "wait till she might be safe from such a companion.  She saw Mrs Clay\n",
      "fairly off, therefore, before she began to talk of spending the morning\n",
      "in Rivers Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well,\" said Elizabeth, \"I have nothing to send but my love.  Oh!\n",
      "you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me, and\n",
      "pretend I have read it through.  I really cannot be plaguing myself for\n",
      "ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out.\n",
      "Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications.  You need not\n",
      "tell her so, but I thought her dress hideous the other night.  I used\n",
      "to think she had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her at the\n",
      "concert.  Something so formal and _arrangé_ in her air!  and she sits so\n",
      "upright!  My best love, of course.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And mine,\" added Sir Walter.  \"Kindest regards.  And you may say, that\n",
      "I mean to call upon her soon.  Make a civil message; but I shall only\n",
      "leave my card.  Morning visits are never fair by women at her time of\n",
      "life, who make themselves up so little.  If she would only wear rouge\n",
      "she would not be afraid of being seen; but last time I called, I\n",
      "observed the blinds were let down immediately.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While her father spoke, there was a knock at the door.  Who could it\n",
      "be?  Anne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of Mr\n",
      "Elliot, would have expected him, but for his known engagement seven\n",
      "miles off.  After the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of\n",
      "approach were heard, and \"Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove\" were ushered\n",
      "into the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance; but Anne\n",
      "was really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry but that\n",
      "they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon as it became\n",
      "clear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived with any\n",
      "views of accommodation in that house, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were\n",
      "able to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well.  They\n",
      "were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove, and were at the\n",
      "White Hart.  So much was pretty soon understood; but till Sir Walter\n",
      "and Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing-room, and\n",
      "regaling themselves with her admiration, Anne could not draw upon\n",
      "Charles's brain for a regular history of their coming, or an\n",
      "explanation of some smiling hints of particular business, which had\n",
      "been ostentatiously dropped by Mary, as well as of some apparent\n",
      "confusion as to whom their party consisted of.\n",
      "\n",
      "She then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove, Henrietta, and\n",
      "Captain Harville, beside their two selves.  He gave her a very plain,\n",
      "intelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw a great\n",
      "deal of most characteristic proceeding.  The scheme had received its\n",
      "first impulse by Captain Harville's wanting to come to Bath on\n",
      "business.  He had begun to talk of it a week ago; and by way of doing\n",
      "something, as shooting was over, Charles had proposed coming with him,\n",
      "and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it very much, as an\n",
      "advantage to her husband; but Mary could not bear to be left, and had\n",
      "made herself so unhappy about it, that for a day or two everything\n",
      "seemed to be in suspense, or at an end.  But then, it had been taken up\n",
      "by his father and mother.  His mother had some old friends in Bath whom\n",
      "she wanted to see; it was thought a good opportunity for Henrietta to\n",
      "come and buy wedding-clothes for herself and her sister; and, in short,\n",
      "it ended in being his mother's party, that everything might be\n",
      "comfortable and easy to Captain Harville; and he and Mary were included\n",
      "in it by way of general convenience.  They had arrived late the night\n",
      "before.  Mrs Harville, her children, and Captain Benwick, remained with\n",
      "Mr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne's only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough\n",
      "for Henrietta's wedding-clothes to be talked of.  She had imagined such\n",
      "difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage\n",
      "from being near at hand; but she learned from Charles that, very\n",
      "recently, (since Mary's last letter to herself), Charles Hayter had\n",
      "been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not\n",
      "possibly claim it under many years; and that on the strength of his\n",
      "present income, with almost a certainty of something more permanent\n",
      "long before the term in question, the two families had consented to the\n",
      "young people's wishes, and that their marriage was likely to take place\n",
      "in a few months, quite as soon as Louisa's.  \"And a very good living it\n",
      "was,\" Charles added:  \"only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross, and\n",
      "in a very fine country: fine part of Dorsetshire.  In the centre of\n",
      "some of the best preserves in the kingdom, surrounded by three great\n",
      "proprietors, each more careful and jealous than the other; and to two\n",
      "of the three at least, Charles Hayter might get a special\n",
      "recommendation.  Not that he will value it as he ought,\" he observed,\n",
      "\"Charles is too cool about sporting. That's the worst of him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am extremely glad, indeed,\" cried Anne, \"particularly glad that this\n",
      "should happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve equally well,\n",
      "and who have always been such good friends, the pleasant prospect of\n",
      "one should not be dimming those of the other--that they should be so\n",
      "equal in their prosperity and comfort.  I hope your father and mother\n",
      "are quite happy with regard to both.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! yes.  My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were\n",
      "richer, but he has no other fault to find.  Money, you know, coming\n",
      "down with money--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable\n",
      "operation, and it streightens him as to many things.  However, I do not\n",
      "mean to say they have not a right to it.  It is very fit they should\n",
      "have daughters' shares; and I am sure he has always been a very kind,\n",
      "liberal father to me.  Mary does not above half like Henrietta's match.\n",
      "She never did, you know.  But she does not do him justice, nor think\n",
      "enough about Winthrop.  I cannot make her attend to the value of the\n",
      "property.  It is a very fair match, as times go; and I have liked\n",
      "Charles Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove,\" exclaimed Anne,\n",
      "\"should be happy in their children's marriages.  They do everything to\n",
      "confer happiness, I am sure.  What a blessing to young people to be in\n",
      "such hands!  Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those\n",
      "ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery,\n",
      "both in young and old.  I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered\n",
      "now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He answered rather hesitatingly, \"Yes, I believe I do; very much\n",
      "recovered; but she is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no\n",
      "laughing or dancing; it is quite different.  If one happens only to\n",
      "shut the door a little hard, she starts and wriggles like a young\n",
      "dab-chick in the water; and Benwick sits at her elbow, reading verses,\n",
      "or whispering to her, all day long.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne could not help laughing.  \"That cannot be much to your taste, I\n",
      "know,\" said she; \"but I do believe him to be an excellent young man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure he is.  Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think I am\n",
      "so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and\n",
      "pleasures as myself.  I have a great value for Benwick; and when one\n",
      "can but get him to talk, he has plenty to say.  His reading has done\n",
      "him no harm, for he has fought as well as read.  He is a brave fellow.\n",
      "I got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before.  We\n",
      "had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in my father's great\n",
      "barns; and he played his part so well that I have liked him the better\n",
      "ever since.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles's\n",
      "following the others to admire mirrors and china; but Anne had heard\n",
      "enough to understand the present state of Uppercross, and rejoice in\n",
      "its happiness; and though she sighed as she rejoiced, her sigh had none\n",
      "of the ill-will of envy in it.  She would certainly have risen to their\n",
      "blessings if she could, but she did not want to lessen theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The visit passed off altogether in high good humour.  Mary was in\n",
      "excellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change, and so well\n",
      "satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law's carriage with four\n",
      "horses, and with her own complete independence of Camden Place, that\n",
      "she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought, and\n",
      "enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house, as they\n",
      "were detailed to her.  She had no demands on her father or sister, and\n",
      "her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome\n",
      "drawing-rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal.  She felt that\n",
      "Mrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them; but\n",
      "she could not bear to have the difference of style, the reduction of\n",
      "servants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by those who had been\n",
      "always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch.  It was a struggle\n",
      "between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better, and then\n",
      "Elizabeth was happy again.  These were her internal persuasions: \"Old\n",
      "fashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess to give\n",
      "dinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does; did not even\n",
      "ask her own sister's family, though they were here a month: and I dare\n",
      "say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove; put her quite out of\n",
      "her way.  I am sure she would rather not come; she cannot feel easy\n",
      "with us.  I will ask them all for an evening; that will be much better;\n",
      "that will be a novelty and a treat.  They have not seen two such\n",
      "drawing rooms before.  They will be delighted to come to-morrow\n",
      "evening.  It shall be a regular party, small, but most elegant.\"  And\n",
      "this satisfied Elizabeth:  and when the invitation was given to the two\n",
      "present, and promised for the absent, Mary was as completely satisfied.\n",
      "She was particularly asked to meet Mr Elliot, and be introduced to Lady\n",
      "Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, who were fortunately already engaged to\n",
      "come; and she could not have received a more gratifying attention.\n",
      "Miss Elliot was to have the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the\n",
      "course of the morning; and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary, to go\n",
      "and see her and Henrietta directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present.\n",
      "They all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes; but\n",
      "Anne convinced herself that a day's delay of the intended communication\n",
      "could be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the White Hart, to\n",
      "see again the friends and companions of the last autumn, with an\n",
      "eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form.\n",
      "\n",
      "They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within, and by themselves, and\n",
      "Anne had the kindest welcome from each.  Henrietta was exactly in that\n",
      "state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness, which made\n",
      "her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before\n",
      "at all; and Mrs Musgrove's real affection had been won by her\n",
      "usefulness when they were in distress.  It was a heartiness, and a\n",
      "warmth, and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more, from the sad\n",
      "want of such blessings at home.  She was entreated to give them as much\n",
      "of her time as possible, invited for every day and all day long, or\n",
      "rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return, she naturally\n",
      "fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance, and on\n",
      "Charles's leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Musgrove's\n",
      "history of Louisa, and to Henrietta's of herself, giving opinions on\n",
      "business, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help\n",
      "which Mary required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts;\n",
      "from finding her keys, and assorting her trinkets, to trying to\n",
      "convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody; which Mary, well\n",
      "amused as she generally was, in her station at a window overlooking the\n",
      "entrance to the Pump Room, could not but have her moments of imagining.\n",
      "\n",
      "A morning of thorough confusion was to be expected.  A large party in\n",
      "an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene.  One five minutes\n",
      "brought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne had not been there half an\n",
      "hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was, seemed more than half\n",
      "filled:  a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs Musgrove,\n",
      "and Charles came back with Captains Harville and Wentworth.  The\n",
      "appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the\n",
      "moment.  It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this\n",
      "arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together\n",
      "again.  Their last meeting had been most important in opening his\n",
      "feelings; she had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she\n",
      "feared from his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had\n",
      "hastened him away from the Concert Room, still governed.  He did not\n",
      "seem to want to be near enough for conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "She tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course, and tried\n",
      "to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--\"Surely, if\n",
      "there be constant attachment on each side, our hearts must understand\n",
      "each other ere long.  We are not boy and girl, to be captiously\n",
      "irritable, misled by every moment's inadvertence, and wantonly playing\n",
      "with our own happiness.\"  And yet, a few minutes afterwards, she felt\n",
      "as if their being in company with each other, under their present\n",
      "circumstances, could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and\n",
      "misconstructions of the most mischievous kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anne,\" cried Mary, still at her window, \"there is Mrs Clay, I am sure,\n",
      "standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her.  I saw them\n",
      "turn the corner from Bath Street just now.  They seemed deep in talk.\n",
      "Who is it?  Come, and tell me.  Good heavens! I recollect.  It is Mr\n",
      "Elliot himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" cried Anne, quickly, \"it cannot be Mr Elliot, I assure you.  He\n",
      "was to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back till\n",
      "to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she spoke, she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her, the\n",
      "consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regret\n",
      "that she had said so much, simple as it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin,\n",
      "began talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting\n",
      "still more positively that it was Mr Elliot, calling again upon Anne to\n",
      "come and look for herself, but Anne did not mean to stir, and tried to\n",
      "be cool and unconcerned.  Her distress returned, however, on perceiving\n",
      "smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady\n",
      "visitors, as if they believed themselves quite in the secret.  It was\n",
      "evident that the report concerning her had spread, and a short pause\n",
      "succeeded, which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do come, Anne,\" cried Mary, \"come and look yourself.  You will be too\n",
      "late if you do not make haste.  They are parting; they are shaking\n",
      "hands.  He is turning away.  Not know Mr Elliot, indeed!  You seem to\n",
      "have forgot all about Lyme.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To pacify Mary, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment, Anne did move\n",
      "quietly to the window.  She was just in time to ascertain that it\n",
      "really was Mr Elliot, which she had never believed, before he\n",
      "disappeared on one side, as Mrs Clay walked quickly off on the other;\n",
      "and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an\n",
      "appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally\n",
      "opposite interest, she calmly said, \"Yes, it is Mr Elliot, certainly.\n",
      "He has changed his hour of going, I suppose, that is all, or I may be\n",
      "mistaken, I might not attend;\" and walked back to her chair,\n",
      "recomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself\n",
      "well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The visitors took their leave; and Charles, having civilly seen them\n",
      "off, and then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began\n",
      "with--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, mother, I have done something for you that you will like.  I\n",
      "have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night.  A'n't\n",
      "I a good boy?  I know you love a play; and there is room for us all.\n",
      "It holds nine.  I have engaged Captain Wentworth.  Anne will not be\n",
      "sorry to join us, I am sure.  We all like a play.  Have not I done\n",
      "well, mother?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect\n",
      "readiness for the play, if Henrietta and all the others liked it, when\n",
      "Mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good heavens, Charles! how can you think of such a thing?  Take a box\n",
      "for to-morrow night!  Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camden\n",
      "Place to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly asked to meet\n",
      "Lady Dalrymple and her daughter, and Mr Elliot, and all the principal\n",
      "family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them?  How can you be\n",
      "so forgetful?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh! Charles, I declare it will be too abominable if you do, when you\n",
      "promised to go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I did not promise.  I only smirked and bowed, and said the word\n",
      "'happy.'  There was no promise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you must go, Charles.  It would be unpardonable to fail.  We were\n",
      "asked on purpose to be introduced.  There was always such a great\n",
      "connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves.  Nothing ever happened\n",
      "on either side that was not announced immediately.  We are quite near\n",
      "relations, you know; and Mr Elliot too, whom you ought so particularly\n",
      "to be acquainted with!  Every attention is due to Mr Elliot.  Consider,\n",
      "my father's heir:  the future representative of the family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't talk to me about heirs and representatives,\" cried Charles.  \"I\n",
      "am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising\n",
      "sun.  If I would not go for the sake of your father, I should think it\n",
      "scandalous to go for the sake of his heir.  What is Mr Elliot to me?\"\n",
      "The careless expression was life to Anne, who saw that Captain\n",
      "Wentworth was all attention, looking and listening with his whole soul;\n",
      "and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from Charles to\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style; he, half serious\n",
      "and half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she,\n",
      "invariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting to make\n",
      "it known that, however determined to go to Camden Place herself, she\n",
      "should not think herself very well used, if they went to the play\n",
      "without her.  Mrs Musgrove interposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We had better put it off.  Charles, you had much better go back and\n",
      "change the box for Tuesday.  It would be a pity to be divided, and we\n",
      "should be losing Miss Anne, too, if there is a party at her father's;\n",
      "and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play,\n",
      "if Miss Anne could not be with us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness; and quite as much so\n",
      "for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it depended only on my inclination, ma'am, the party at home\n",
      "(excepting on Mary's account) would not be the smallest impediment.  I\n",
      "have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy to\n",
      "change it for a play, and with you.  But, it had better not be\n",
      "attempted, perhaps.\"  She had spoken it; but she trembled when it was\n",
      "done, conscious that her words were listened to, and daring not even to\n",
      "try to observe their effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day; Charles\n",
      "only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife, by persisting\n",
      "that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Wentworth left his seat, and walked to the fire-place; probably\n",
      "for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards, and taking a\n",
      "station, with less bare-faced design, by Anne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have not been long enough in Bath,\" said he, \"to enjoy the evening\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am not yet so much changed,\" cried Anne, and stopped, fearing she\n",
      "hardly knew what misconstruction.  After waiting a few moments he said,\n",
      "and as if it were the result of immediate feeling, \"It is a period,\n",
      "indeed!  Eight years and a half is a period.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne's imagination\n",
      "to ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds he\n",
      "had uttered, she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta, eager to\n",
      "make use of the present leisure for getting out, and calling on her\n",
      "companions to lose no time, lest somebody else should come in.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were obliged to move.  Anne talked of being perfectly ready, and\n",
      "tried to look it; but she felt that could Henrietta have known the\n",
      "regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair, in preparing\n",
      "to quit the room, she would have found, in all her own sensations for\n",
      "her cousin, in the very security of his affection, wherewith to pity\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their preparations, however, were stopped short.  Alarming sounds were\n",
      "heard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open for Sir\n",
      "Walter and Miss Elliot, whose entrance seemed to give a general chill.\n",
      "Anne felt an instant oppression, and wherever she looked saw symptoms\n",
      "of the same.  The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety of the room was\n",
      "over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence, or insipid talk,\n",
      "to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister.  How\n",
      "mortifying to feel that it was so!\n",
      "\n",
      "Her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular.  Captain Wentworth was\n",
      "acknowledged again by each, by Elizabeth more graciously than before.\n",
      "She even addressed him once, and looked at him more than once.\n",
      "Elizabeth was, in fact, revolving a great measure.  The sequel\n",
      "explained it.  After the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper\n",
      "nothings, she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all\n",
      "the remaining dues of the Musgroves.  \"To-morrow evening, to meet a few\n",
      "friends:  no formal party.\" It was all said very gracefully, and the\n",
      "cards with which she had provided herself, the \"Miss Elliot at home,\"\n",
      "were laid on the table, with a courteous, comprehensive smile to all,\n",
      "and one smile and one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth.  The\n",
      "truth was, that Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand\n",
      "the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his.  The past\n",
      "was nothing.  The present was that Captain Wentworth would move about\n",
      "well in her drawing-room.  The card was pointedly given, and Sir Walter\n",
      "and Elizabeth arose and disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation\n",
      "returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out, but not\n",
      "to Anne.  She could think only of the invitation she had with such\n",
      "astonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which it had been\n",
      "received; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather than\n",
      "gratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance.  She\n",
      "knew him; she saw disdain in his eye, and could not venture to believe\n",
      "that he had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement for\n",
      "all the insolence of the past.  Her spirits sank.  He held the card in\n",
      "his hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only think of Elizabeth's including everybody!\" whispered Mary very\n",
      "audibly.  \"I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted!  You see he\n",
      "cannot put the card out of his hand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth form itself\n",
      "into a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away, that she\n",
      "might neither see nor hear more to vex her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The party separated.  The gentlemen had their own pursuits, the ladies\n",
      "proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while Anne\n",
      "belonged to them.  She was earnestly begged to return and dine, and\n",
      "give them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been so long\n",
      "exerted that at present she felt unequal to more, and fit only for\n",
      "home, where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning,\n",
      "therefore, she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to\n",
      "Camden Place, there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the\n",
      "busy arrangements of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow's party, the\n",
      "frequent enumeration of the persons invited, and the continually\n",
      "improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the\n",
      "most completely elegant of its kind in Bath, while harassing herself\n",
      "with the never-ending question, of whether Captain Wentworth would come\n",
      "or not?  They were reckoning him as certain, but with her it was a\n",
      "gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together.  She\n",
      "generally thought he would come, because she generally thought he\n",
      "ought; but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive\n",
      "act of duty or discretion, as inevitably to defy the suggestions of\n",
      "very opposite feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "She only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation,\n",
      "to let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot three hours\n",
      "after his being supposed to be out of Bath, for having watched in vain\n",
      "for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself, she\n",
      "determined to mention it, and it seemed to her there was guilt in Mrs\n",
      "Clay's face as she listened.  It was transient: cleared away in an\n",
      "instant; but Anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of\n",
      "having, by some complication of mutual trick, or some overbearing\n",
      "authority of his, been obliged to attend (perhaps for half an hour) to\n",
      "his lectures and restrictions on her designs on Sir Walter.  She\n",
      "exclaimed, however, with a very tolerable imitation of nature:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! dear! very true.  Only think, Miss Elliot, to my great surprise I\n",
      "met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street.  I was never more astonished.  He\n",
      "turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard.  He had been prevented\n",
      "setting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what; for I was in a\n",
      "hurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer for his being\n",
      "determined not to be delayed in his return.  He wanted to know how\n",
      "early he might be admitted to-morrow.  He was full of 'to-morrow,' and\n",
      "it is very evident that I have been full of it too, ever since I\n",
      "entered the house, and learnt the extension of your plan and all that\n",

      "keener interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched by Mr\n",
      "Elliot's conduct, except by its effects in one quarter, that it became\n",
      "a matter of course the next morning, still to defer her explanatory\n",

      "she did not belong to the conversation, and yet, as Captain Harville\n",
      "seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk, she could not avoid hearing\n",

      "and what I said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards\n",
      "persuaded to think might do very well,\" and a great deal in the same\n",
      "style of open-hearted communication:  minutiae which, even with every\n",
      "advantage of taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could not\n",
      "give, could be properly interesting only to the principals.  Mrs Croft\n",
      "was attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all, it\n",

      "altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer, for\n",
      "Charles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was pretty near\n",

      "it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible that he\n",
      "was inviting her to join him where he stood.  He looked at her with a\n",
      "smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed, \"Come to me, I\n",
      "have something to say;\" and the unaffected, easy kindness of manner\n",
      "which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was,\n",
      "strongly enforced the invitation.  She roused herself and went to him.\n",

      "Wentworth's table, not very near.  As she joined him, Captain\n",
      "Harville's countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful expression\n",

      "\n",

      "not done for her.  Miss Elliot, do you remember our walking together at\n",
      "Lyme, and grieving for him?  I little thought then--but no matter.\n",
      "This was drawn at the Cape.  He met with a clever young German artist\n",
      "at the Cape, and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister, sat to\n",
      "him, and was bringing it home for her; and I have now the charge of\n",

      "who else was there to employ?  I hope I can allow for him.  I am not\n",

      "\"No,\" replied Anne, in a low, feeling voice. \"That I can easily\n",

      "do not forget you as soon as you forget us.  It is, perhaps, our fate\n",
      "rather than our merit.  We cannot help ourselves.  We live at home,\n",
      "quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us.  You are forced on\n",
      "exertion.  You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some\n",
      "sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and\n",
      "continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men\n",
      "(which, however, I do not think I shall grant), it does not apply to\n",
      "Benwick.  He has not been forced upon any exertion.  The peace turned\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, no, it is not man's nature.  I will not allow it to be more man's\n",
      "nature than woman's to be inconstant and forget those they do love, or\n",
      "have loved.  I believe the reverse.  I believe in a true analogy\n",
      "between our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are\n",
      "the strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough\n",
      "usage, and riding out the heaviest weather.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your feelings may be the strongest,\" replied Anne, \"but the same\n",
      "spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most\n",
      "tender.  Man is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived;\n",
      "which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.\n",
      "Nay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.  You have\n",
      "difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with.  You\n",
      "are always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship.\n",

      "suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by\n",

      "\n",
      "\"There is no hurry on my side.  I am only ready whenever you are.  I am\n",
      "in very good anchorage here,\" (smiling at Anne,) \"well supplied, and\n",

      "(lowering his voice,) \"as I was saying we shall never agree, I suppose,\n",
      "upon this point.  No man and woman, would, probably.  But let me\n",
      "observe that all histories are against you--all stories, prose and\n",
      "verse.  If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring you fifty\n",
      "quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think I\n",
      "ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon\n",
      "woman's inconstancy.  Songs and proverbs, all talk of woman's\n",
      "fickleness.  But perhaps you will say, these were all written by men.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps I shall.  Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples in\n",
      "books.  Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story.\n",
      "Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been\n",
      "in their hands.  I will not allow books to prove anything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But how shall we prove anything?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We never shall.  We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a\n",
      "point.  It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof.\n",
      "We each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex; and\n",
      "upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has\n",
      "occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances (perhaps\n",
      "those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such as\n",
      "cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence, or in some\n",
      "respect saying what should not be said.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" cried Captain Harville, in a tone of strong feeling, \"if I could\n",
      "but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at\n",
      "his wife and children, and watches the boat that he has sent them off\n",
      "in, as long as it is in sight, and then turns away and says, 'God knows\n",
      "whether we ever meet again!' And then, if I could convey to you the\n",
      "glow of his soul when he does see them again; when, coming back after a\n",
      "twelvemonth's absence, perhaps, and obliged to put into another port,\n",
      "he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there, pretending to\n",
      "deceive himself, and saying, 'They cannot be here till such a day,' but\n",
      "all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them\n",
      "arrive at last, as if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner\n",
      "still!  If I could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear\n",
      "and do, and glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his\n",
      "existence!  I speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!\"\n",
      "pressing his own with emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" cried Anne eagerly, \"I hope I do justice to all that is felt by\n",
      "you, and by those who resemble you.  God forbid that I should\n",
      "undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my\n",
      "fellow-creatures!  I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to\n",
      "suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman.\n",
      "No, I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married\n",
      "lives.  I believe you equal to every important exertion, and to every\n",
      "domestic forbearance, so long as--if I may be allowed the\n",
      "expression--so long as you have an object.  I meanwhile the woman you\n",
      "love lives, and lives for you.  All the privilege I claim for my own\n",
      "sex (it is not a very enviable one; you need not covet it), is that of\n",
      "loving longest, when existence or when hope is gone.\"\n",

      "Mrs Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, having sealed his letter\n",
      "with great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried, agitated\n",
      "air, which shewed impatience to be gone.  Anne knew not how to\n",
      "understand it.  She had the kindest \"Good morning, God bless you!\" from\n",
      "Captain Harville, but from him not a word, nor a look!  He had passed\n",
      "out of the room without a look!\n",
      "\n",
      "She had only time, however, to move closer to the table where he had\n",
      "been writing, when footsteps were heard returning; the door opened, it\n",
      "was himself.  He begged their pardon, but he had forgotten his gloves,\n",
      "and instantly crossing the room to the writing table, he drew out a\n",
      "letter from under the scattered paper, placed it before Anne with eyes\n",
      "of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time, and hastily collecting his\n",
      "gloves, was again out of the room, almost before Mrs Musgrove was aware\n",
      "of his being in it: the work of an instant!\n",
      "\n",
      "The revolution which one instant had made in Anne, was almost beyond\n",
      "expression.  The letter, with a direction hardly legible, to \"Miss A.\n",
      "E.--,\" was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily.\n",
      "While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick, he had been also\n",
      "addressing her!  On the contents of that letter depended all which this\n",
      "world could do for her.  Anything was possible, anything might be\n",
      "defied rather than suspense.  Mrs Musgrove had little arrangements of\n",
      "her own at her own table; to their protection she must trust, and\n",
      "sinking into the chair which he had occupied, succeeding to the very\n",
      "spot where he had leaned and written, her eyes devoured the following\n",
      "words:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can listen no longer in silence.  I must speak to you by such means\n",

      "hope.  Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are\n",
      "gone for ever.  I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your\n",
      "own than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago.  Dare\n",
      "not say that man forgets sooner than  woman, that his love has an\n",
      "earlier death.  I have loved none but you.  Unjust I may have been,\n",
      "weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant.  You alone have\n",
      "brought me to Bath.  For you alone, I think and plan.  Have you not\n",
      "seen this?  Can you fail to have understood my wishes?  I had not\n",
      "waited even these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think\n",
      "you must have penetrated mine.  I can hardly write.  I am every instant\n",
      "hearing something which overpowers me.  You sink your voice, but I can\n",
      "distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others.\n",
      "Too good, too excellent creature!  You do us justice, indeed.  You do\n",

      "it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither, or follow\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a letter was not to be soon recovered from.  Half an hour's\n",
      "solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her; but the ten\n",
      "minutes only which now passed before she was interrupted, with all the\n",
      "restraints of her situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.\n",
      "Every moment rather brought fresh agitation.  It was overpowering\n",
      "happiness.  And before she was beyond the first stage of full\n",
      "sensation, Charles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an\n",
      "immediate struggle; but after a while she could do no more.  She began\n",
      "not to understand a word they said, and was obliged to plead\n",
      "indisposition and excuse herself.  They could then see that she looked\n",
      "very ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not stir without her\n",
      "for the world.  This was dreadful.  Would they only have gone away, and\n",
      "left her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her\n",
      "cure; but to have them all standing or waiting around her was\n",
      "distracting, and in desperation, she said she would go home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By all means, my dear,\" cried Mrs Musgrove, \"go home directly, and\n",
      "take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening.  I wish\n",
      "Sarah was here to doctor you, but I am no doctor myself.  Charles, ring\n",
      "and order a chair.  She must not walk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the chair would never do.  Worse than all!  To lose the possibility\n",
      "of speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet,\n",
      "solitary progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meeting\n",
      "him) could not be borne.  The chair was earnestly protested against,\n",
      "and Mrs Musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness, having\n",
      "assured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall in the\n",
      "case; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down, and got a blow\n",
      "on her head; that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall;\n",
      "could part with her cheerfully, and depend on finding her better at\n",
      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anxious to omit no possible precaution, Anne struggled, and said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid, ma'am, that it is not perfectly understood.  Pray be so\n",
      "good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your\n",
      "whole party this evening.  I am afraid there had been some mistake; and\n",
      "I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain\n",
      "Wentworth, that we hope to see them both.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word.  Captain\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Do you think so?  But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"To be sure I will, if you wish it.  Charles, if you see Captain\n",
      "Harville anywhere, remember to give Miss Anne's message.  But indeed,\n",
      "my dear, you need not be uneasy.  Captain Harville holds himself quite\n",
      "engaged, I'll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare\n",
      "say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp\n",
      "the perfection of her felicity.  It could not be very lasting, however.\n",
      "Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself, it would be in her\n",
      "power to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Harville.  Another\n",
      "momentary vexation occurred.  Charles, in his real concern and good\n",
      "nature, would go home with her; there was no preventing him.  This was\n",
      "almost cruel.  But she could not be long ungrateful; he was sacrificing\n",
      "an engagement at a gunsmith's, to be of use to her; and she set off\n",
      "with him, with no feeling but gratitude apparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were on Union Street, when a quicker step behind, a something of\n",
      "familiar sound, gave her two moments' preparation for the sight of\n",
      "Captain Wentworth.  He joined them; but, as if irresolute whether to\n",
      "join or to pass on, said nothing, only looked.  Anne could command\n",
      "herself enough to receive that look, and not repulsively.  The cheeks\n",
      "which had been pale now glowed, and the movements which had hesitated\n",
      "were decided.  He walked by her side.  Presently, struck by a sudden\n",
      "thought, Charles said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Captain Wentworth, which way are you going?  Only to Gay Street, or\n",
      "farther up the town?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hardly know,\" replied Captain Wentworth, surprised.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you going as high as Belmont?  Are you going near Camden Place?\n",
      "Because, if you are, I shall have no scruple in asking you to take my\n",
      "place, and give Anne your arm to her father's door.  She is rather done\n",
      "for this morning, and must not go so far without help, and I ought to\n",
      "be at that fellow's in the Market Place.  He promised me the sight of a\n",
      "capital gun he is just going to send off; said he would keep it\n",
      "unpacked to the last possible moment, that I might see it; and if I do\n",
      "not turn back now, I have no chance.  By his description, a good deal\n",
      "like the second size double-barrel of mine, which you shot with one day\n",
      "round Winthrop.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There could not be an objection.  There could be only the most proper\n",
      "alacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view; and smiles reined\n",
      "in and spirits dancing in private rapture.  In half a minute Charles\n",
      "was at the bottom of Union Street again, and the other two proceeding\n",
      "together:  and soon words enough had passed between them to decide\n",
      "their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel\n",
      "walk, where the power of conversation would make the present hour a\n",
      "blessing indeed, and prepare it for all the immortality which the\n",
      "happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow.  There\n",
      "they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once\n",
      "before seemed to secure everything, but which had been followed by so\n",
      "many, many years of division and estrangement.  There they returned\n",
      "again into the past, more exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their\n",
      "re-union, than when it had been first projected; more tender, more\n",
      "tried, more fixed in a knowledge of each other's character, truth, and\n",
      "attachment; more equal to act, more justified in acting.  And there, as\n",
      "they slowly paced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around\n",
      "them, seeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers,\n",
      "flirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in\n",
      "those retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in those\n",
      "explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment, which\n",
      "were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest.  All the little\n",
      "variations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday and\n",
      "today there could scarcely be an end.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not mistaken him.  Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding\n",
      "weight, the doubt, the torment.  That had begun to operate in the very\n",
      "hour of first meeting her in Bath; that had returned, after a short\n",
      "suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him in\n",
      "everything he had said and done, or omitted to say and do, in the last\n",
      "four-and-twenty hours.  It had been gradually yielding to the better\n",
      "hopes which her looks, or words, or actions occasionally encouraged; it\n",
      "had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which\n",
      "had reached him while she talked with Captain Harville; and under the\n",
      "irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper, and\n",
      "poured out his feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified.\n",
      "He persisted in having loved none but her.  She had never been\n",
      "supplanted.  He never even believed himself to see her equal.  Thus\n",
      "much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge:  that he had been constant\n",
      "unconsciously, nay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her,\n",
      "and believed it to be done.  He had imagined himself indifferent, when\n",
      "he had only been angry; and he had been unjust to her merits, because\n",
      "he had been a sufferer from them.  Her character was now fixed on his\n",
      "mind as perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of\n",
      "fortitude and gentleness; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only\n",
      "at Uppercross had he learnt to do her justice, and only at Lyme had he\n",
      "begun to understand himself.  At Lyme, he had received lessons of more\n",
      "than one sort.  The passing admiration of Mr Elliot had at least roused\n",
      "him, and the scenes on the Cobb and at Captain Harville's had fixed her\n",
      "superiority.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove (the\n",
      "attempts of angry pride), he protested that he had for ever felt it to\n",
      "be impossible; that he had not cared, could not care, for Louisa;\n",
      "though till that day, till the leisure for reflection which followed\n",
      "it, he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which\n",
      "Louisa's could so ill bear a comparison, or the perfect unrivalled hold\n",
      "it possessed over his own.  There, he had learnt to distinguish between\n",
      "the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self-will, between the\n",
      "darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind.  There\n",
      "he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had\n",
      "lost; and there begun to deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of\n",
      "resentment, which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in\n",
      "his way.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that period his penance had become severe.  He had no sooner been\n",
      "free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of\n",
      "Louisa's accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again, than he\n",
      "had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I found,\" said he, \"that I was considered by Harville an engaged man!\n",
      "That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual\n",
      "attachment.  I was startled and shocked.  To a degree, I could\n",
      "contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect that others\n",
      "might have felt the same--her own family, nay, perhaps herself--I was\n",
      "no longer at my own disposal.  I was hers in honour if she wished it.\n",
      "I had been unguarded.  I had not thought seriously on this subject\n",
      "before.  I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its\n",
      "danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had no right to be\n",
      "trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls, at the\n",
      "risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other ill\n",
      "effects.  I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself; and that\n",
      "precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for Louisa at\n",
      "all, he must regard himself as bound to her, if her sentiments for him\n",
      "were what the Harvilles supposed.  It determined him to leave Lyme, and\n",
      "await her complete recovery elsewhere.  He would gladly weaken, by any\n",
      "fair means, whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might\n",
      "exist; and he went, therefore, to his brother's, meaning after a while\n",
      "to return to Kellynch, and act as circumstances might require.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was six weeks with Edward,\" said he, \"and saw him happy.  I could\n",
      "have no other pleasure.  I deserved none.  He enquired after you very\n",
      "particularly; asked even if you were personally altered, little\n",
      "suspecting that to my eye you could never alter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne smiled, and let it pass.  It was too pleasing a blunder for a\n",
      "reproach.  It is something for a woman to be assured, in her\n",
      "eight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm of earlier\n",
      "youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to\n",
      "Anne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be the\n",
      "result, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his own\n",
      "pride, and the blunders of his own calculations, till at once released\n",
      "from Louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her\n",
      "engagement with Benwick.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here,\" said he, \"ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least\n",
      "put myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself; I could do\n",
      "something.  But to be waiting so long in inaction, and waiting only for\n",
      "evil, had been dreadful.  Within the first five minutes I said, 'I will\n",
      "be at Bath on Wednesday,' and I was.  Was it unpardonable to think it\n",
      "worth my while to come? and to arrive with some degree of hope?  You\n",

      "If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that it was to\n",
      "persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk.  When I yielded,\n",
      "I thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called in aid here.  In\n",

      "\"Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus,\" he replied, \"but I could not.\n",
      "I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired of\n",
      "your character.  I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed,\n",
      "buried, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under\n",
      "year after year.  I could think of you only as one who had yielded, who\n",
      "had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me.\n",
      "I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to\n",

      "could have conceived.  All the surprise and suspense, and every other\n",
      "painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation, she\n",
      "re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some\n",
      "momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last.  An interval\n",
      "of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective of\n",

      "business, too numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anne\n",
      "had never found an evening shorter.  Glowing and lovely in sensibility\n",
      "and happiness, and more generally admired than she thought about or\n",
      "cared for, she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially to judge of\n",

      "that I was right, much as I suffered from it, that I was perfectly\n",
      "right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you\n",
      "do now.  To me, she was in the place of a parent.  Do not mistake me,\n",
      "however.  I am not saying that she did not err in her advice.  It was,\n",
      "perhaps, one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the\n",
      "event decides; and for myself, I certainly never should, in any\n",

      "that I was right in submitting to her, and that if I had done\n",
      "otherwise, I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement\n",
      "than I did even in giving it up, because I should have suffered in my\n",
      "conscience.  I have now, as far as such a sentiment is allowable in\n",
      "human nature, nothing to reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a\n",

      "my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice.  This is a\n",

      "myself.  Six years of separation and suffering might have been spared.\n",
      "It is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me.  I have been used to the\n",

      "This may be bad morality to conclude with, but I believe it to be\n",

      "an Anne Elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind, consciousness\n",
      "of right, and one independent fortune between them, fail of bearing\n",
      "down every opposition?  They might in fact, have borne down a great\n",
      "deal more than they met with, for there was little to distress them\n",
      "beyond the want of graciousness and warmth.  Sir Walter made no\n",
      "objection, and Elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and\n",
      "unconcerned.  Captain Wentworth, with five-and-twenty thousand pounds,\n",
      "and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him,\n",
      "was no longer nobody.  He was now esteemed quite worthy to address the\n",

      "or sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which\n",
      "Providence had placed him, and who could give his daughter at present\n",
      "but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers\n",
      "hereafter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Walter, indeed, though he had no affection for Anne, and no vanity\n",
      "flattered, to make him really happy on the occasion, was very far from\n",
      "thinking it a bad match for her.  On the contrary, when he saw more of\n",
      "Captain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight, and eyed him well,\n",
      "he was very much struck by his personal claims, and felt that his\n",
      "superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her\n",
      "superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by his well-sounding name,\n",
      "enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen, with a very good grace,\n",
      "for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite any\n",

      "suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot, and\n",
      "be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with, and do\n",
      "justice to Captain Wentworth.  This however was what Lady Russell had\n",
      "now to do.  She must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with\n",

      "each; that because Captain Wentworth's manners had not suited her own\n",

      "character of dangerous impetuosity; and that because Mr Elliot's\n",
      "manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness,\n",
      "their general politeness and suavity, she had been too quick in\n",
      "receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and\n",
      "well-regulated mind.  There was nothing less for Lady Russell to do,\n",
      "than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong, and to take up\n",
      "a new set of opinions and of hopes.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment\n",
      "of character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience in\n",
      "others can equal, and Lady Russell had been less gifted in this part of\n",
      "understanding than her young friend.  But she was a very good woman,\n",
      "and if her second object was to be sensible and well-judging, her first\n",
      "was to see Anne happy.  She loved Anne better than she loved her own\n",
      "abilities; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over, found\n",
      "little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was\n",
      "securing the happiness of her other child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of all the family, Mary was probably the one most immediately gratified\n",

      "connexion, by keeping Anne with her in the autumn; and as her own\n",
      "sister must be better than her husband's sisters, it was very agreeable\n",
      "that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than either Captain\n",
      "Benwick or Charles Hayter.  She had something to suffer, perhaps, when\n",
      "they came into contact again, in seeing Anne restored to the rights of\n",
      "seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette; but she had a\n",
      "future to look forward to, of powerful consolation.  Anne had no\n",
      "Uppercross Hall before her, no landed estate, no headship of a family;\n",
      "and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth from being made a baronet,\n",
      "she would not change situations with Anne.\n",

      "It would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied\n",
      "with her situation, for a change is not very probable there.  She had\n",
      "soon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw, and no one of\n",
      "proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the\n",
      "unfounded hopes which sunk with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The news of his cousin Anne's engagement burst on Mr Elliot most\n",

      "best hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness which a\n",
      "son-in-law's rights would have given.  But, though discomfited and\n",
      "disappointed, he could still do something for his own interest and his\n",
      "own enjoyment.  He soon quitted Bath; and on Mrs Clay's quitting it\n",
      "soon afterwards, and being next heard of as established under his\n",
      "protection in London, it was evident how double a game he had been\n",
      "playing, and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out\n",
      "by one artful woman, at least.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Clay's affections had overpowered her interest, and she had\n",
      "sacrificed, for the young man's sake, the possibility of scheming\n",
      "longer for Sir Walter.  She has abilities, however, as well as\n",
      "affections; and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning, or\n",
      "hers, may finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her from\n",

      "last into making her the wife of Sir William.\n",
      "\n",
      "It cannot be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked and\n",
      "mortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of their\n",
      "deception in her.  They had their great cousins, to be sure, to resort\n",
      "to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow\n",
      "others, without being flattered and followed in turn, is but a state of\n",

      "Anne, satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell's meaning to\n",

      "having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value.\n",
      "There she felt her own inferiority very keenly.  The disproportion in\n",
      "their fortune was nothing; it did not give her a moment's regret; but\n",

      "respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer in return for all the\n",

      "Smith.  To those, however, he was very well disposed to attach himself.\n",

      "Her recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves, and\n",
