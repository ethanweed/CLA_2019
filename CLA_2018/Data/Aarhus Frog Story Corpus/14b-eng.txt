*CHI:	so uh in the first picture uhm it's a picture uh it's uh nighttime .
*CHI:	there's uhm a moon in the background .
*CHI:	and uh this boy uhm he's in his pyjamas uh and he's sitting on this
	little stool and he's looking down in the jar and there is a frog
	and uh his dog is looking down in the jar as well .
*CHI:	in [?] the next picture is the boy sleeping and uhm the dog is
	sleeping on his duvet [?] uh on the blanket while uhm .
*CHI:	they're sleeping very cozy and uh the frog is sneaking out of the
	jar <in this picture> [?] .
*CHI:	in the next picture the boy is looking very surprised and a little
	bit unhappy to see that the frog is gone and he doesn't know where
	it is yes [?] well with his dog very surprised .
*CHI:	On the next picture the boy is looking under these boots he his
	h uh he's looked under his chair it's flipped around .
*CHI:	he's looking everywhere in his room .
*CHI:	his dog looked in the jar and now his head is stuck in the jar .
*CHI:	the boy is now yelling and uh calling after his frog while the dog
	uh is struggling uh or the [?] at least doesn't look that happy to
	have uh this uh jar on his head but uh the boy doesn't seem to
	really care anything of it .
*CHI:	he's not looking at the dog after all .
*CHI:	the next picture the dog is falling down of the window (laugh) with
	the jar on his head and uh the boy doesn't look too happy he looks
	kinda surprised but not too surprised .
*CHI:	and I'm surprised that he doesn't look surprised because this [?] his
	dog is falling .
*CHI:	I would be very sad .
*CHI:	anyway .
*CHI:	he comes down .
*CHI:	there's a picture of the the boy .
*CHI:	looks like he's saved the dog .
*CHI:	uhm the boy is holding him in his arm uh boy is holding uh the dog
	in his arms and uh the dog is licking him obviously probably because
	that he's very happy now .
*CHI:	he's safe by his owner .
*CHI:	but uh the boy doesn't look too happy and I think that's because
	that uh he's licking him and uh I can understand that because that
	not everybody likes to be licked .
*CHI:	but I do (laugh) because that yeah then it just shows me love from a
	dog .
*CHI:	anyway .
*CHI:	the next picture is uhm where this uh the boy is calling and uh the
	dog looks to be uh calling too uh (sniff) .
*CHI:	and there's a few bees in the background and there's a teeny house I
	think that's the boy's house .
*CHI:	but uh yeah .
*CHI:	nice landscape some tree there's like two or three trees .
*CHI:	looks very beautiful looks nice .
*CHI:	uh yeah .
*CHI:	and [?] the next picture there's a picture of some uh some big tall
	trees and some kind of <fat and wired> [?] ones uh some kinda big
	trees and uh yeah .
*CHI:	uhm there is uhm t h bee(hif) uhm I don't quite remember uh what it
	is you call it now it's uh ts ts bee uh .
*CHI:	I don't quite remember it right now that's uh that's a shame (laugh)
	.
*CHI:	anyway you know uh you know uh the bees live in a little uh a a
	little uhm ovalish shape uh yeah I really can't uh remember what uhm
	it's called right now .
*CHI:	I remember in danish it's called bikube I just can't remember what
	it's called right now .
*CHI:	anyway not to spend too much time on that it's where the bees lived
	uh the bees live uh yeah .
*CHI:	you know what that is (...) .
*CHI:	(sniff) h anyway uh (sniff) so uhm the boy now is looking down uhm .
*CHI:	mmt in a hole and I'm shhh I'm not sure what kind of hole it is uh .
*CHI:	it looks like there can actually live many animals down there and uh
	the dog is barking at the ∙hhh (sigh) uh it's actually really
	annoying that I don't can't remember what's it called uh what it
	what it's called .
*CHI:	hm mt bummer .
*CHI:	nå anyway .
*CHI:	so he's yelling at the the b I'm gonna call it the beehouse now .
*CHI:	it sounds stupid but I don't remember what it's called .
*CHI:	anyway mt yeah uhm I'm gonna call it a beehouse (laugh) .
*CHI:	uhm so the beehouse uh the b the dog is barking at the beehouse uhm
	at the yeah I think I'll just call it a beehouse ∙hh .
*CHI:	sounds kinda stupid but uh can't think of anything better actually
	right now .
*CHI:	ts nå .
*CHI:	that's <too bad>[?] .
*CHI:	I'll just call it a beehi a beehouse .
*CHI:	it sounds stupid (laugh) .
*CHI:	alright anyway .
*CHI:	so the bees are flying out because the I think they're pretty scared
	(sniff) of uh the dog uhm yelling and barking out at them all the .
*CHI:	the uhm the boy is looking down in the hole uhm and uh (sniff) .
*CHI:	in this picture the uh the dog is barking even more aggressively
	right now at the the little uh beehou hou uhm house .
*CHI:	yeah I'm just gonna call it a beehouse .
*CHI:	sounds stupid but uh I really can't think of it right now so bummer .
*CHI:	∙hhh (sigh) .
*CHI:	nå <that had> [?] me annoyed ∙hhh uh .
*CHI:	anyway the beehouse .
*CHI:	the dog is barking pretty aggressively uh at the beehouse in this
	uhm in this picture and the bees are flying out cause they're very
	[?] scared very scared and the.
*CHI:	th uhm the boy is holding his uh his hands over his no nose uh
	becau I'm pretty sure he thinks it stinks .
*CHI:	which I can understand and there's a little squirrel popping out of
	the hole there in the picture .
*CHI:	in the next picture uh the squirrel is is kinda looking back at uh
	the dog because there's a big scene there uhm .
*CHI:	uhm you can't see the boy in this picture but oh well uh (laugh)
	that is out of matter uh anyway uh .
*CHI:	mt why I'm pretty sure why the squirrel's looking at the dog uh
	where the action is happing happening back there is because that
	instead of the mm little bee uh house hanging on uh the tree branch
	now it is h successfully crashed down on the ground with plenty of
	bees .
*CHI:	there's ss there's a load of bees there's flying out of that little
	uh h little beehouse there ∙hhh uh and the dog looks kinda surprised
	too .
*CHI:	you guys I really hope that my dad will edit out when I say beehouse
	because that it sounds so stupid (laugh) .
*CHI:	alright uhm (laugh) anyway uhm .
*CHI:	oh shoot uh hello alright .
*CHI:	that was a tragic accident with the microphone uhm I think it's
	ok alright (laugh) well alright loosing my mind alright .
*CHI:	the microphone just fell so it make I think it made a huge l uh
	noise actually hmm alright anyway ∙hhh .
*CHI:	in this picture the boy is uhm well he's looking uhm he's looking at
	in a hole r on his this really thick and kinda big and fat tree with
	a huge big fat uh branch .
*CHI:	∙hhh he's sitting on the branch <they sit>[?] looking into this hole
	which I believe is the where the owl uh will hibernate or uh sleep
	at least and live in this uh little hole .
*CHI:	here we go .
*CHI:	alright .
*CHI:	in this picture .
*CHI:	is this too loud .
*CHI:	I think that's way too loud .
*CHI:	I think that's way too loud alright .
*CHI:	I think this is about good .
*CHI:	alright I think this is good alright .
*CHI:	so in this picture then uhm ts uh there is an owl flying out of this
	uhm flying out of the uh of the hole the little hole where it
	probably lives and he falls back of uh <yes because>[?] he's really
	surprised and lucky for him he's .
*CHI:	oh my god I have a feeling that was so loud cause on my computer the
	waves just go roof right up .
*CHI:	aw thinking way m way much about the microphone than I am about this
	little book [?] ok sorry it's just cause I'm moving this microphone
	it's making all these noises .
*CHI:	alright I think it's good alright anyway .
*CHI:	so uh he's very surprised .
*CHI:	he's falling down backwards on his back (sniff) .
*CHI:	it doesn't look too pleasant and lucky for him all (th) well it's
	not lucky that he fell but it's lucky because that all these bees
	are fl like flying there are so many bees on this picture that is
	flying right past him h right over him and lucky for him he's on the
	ground and not standing up cause otherwise they would have crossed
	into him I'm sure and that wouldn't be nice (sniff) .
*CHI:	in this picture uhm the dog is running like crazy he's running very
	very very fast it seems in this picture away from the bees and there
	uhm <it looks a little bit like a little>[?] the bee in
	front is like one centimeter from uh the dog's tail uh anyway uhm so
	uh ∙hhh .
*CHI:	there are a bunch there's like whole lot of bees just following the
	dog and he's panicking and running (laugh) he he's running for his
	life right now .
*CHI:	that's kind of funny .
*CHI:	mt alright in this picture uhm mt the boy is kind of uh ∙hhh he's
	not too happy because the the owl is kind of right u on t well not
	on top of him but uh kind of flying right over him and uhm uhm .
*CHI:	there are some uh ∙h oh please don't say I can't remember how [?] to
	say this ∙hh ugh .
*CHI:	I'm a dane but I uh I feel like uhm I feel like english is easier .
*CHI:	ugh this is annoying .
*CHI:	I can't say how to say a bee like y you know a bikube I can't say
	that in english don't remember .
*CHI:	ugh .
*CHI:	ugh oh my god .
*CHI:	uhm I think uh I think it'll probably come back to me in just a
	second alright .
*CHI:	so anyway he's uhm he's by the rock and uhm he is not looking too
	happy cause the owl's over him and uh there are these horns from a
	reindeer uhm mt .
*CHI:	just a second I just need to .
*CHI:	so uh yeah so he's on the rock and he's kind of kind of holding on
	for [?] the rock and uh he doesn't look too happy cause the owl is
	like pretty close to him and uh yeah .
*CHI:	n ok now I remember antlers right uhm .
*CHI:	so there are these antlers kinda sticking up from the r rock and th
	it's a huge rock so ∙hh can only see the antlers that's how big the
	rock is cause I'm pretty sure there's a reindeer behind it and uhm
	mt yeah doesn't look too pleasant either .
*CHI:	yeah the bird is now on the tree safe from the boy and boy's
	safe from the owl .
*CHI:	he's not thinking about the right now you can see .
*CHI:	he's distracted let [?] and he's holding on to these antlers
	probably thinking it's a branch or uh yeah a sort of branch uh
	branch because that there's a lot of branches on the trees and the
	bushes right uh in the background and it looks like it's pretty
	<close to him>[?] so it looks like uhm it's a whole bunch of uh
	uhm ∙hhh hhhh∙ (...) yeah uhm uhm trees uhm yeah <it's a lot like>[?]
	trees and sticks that he's holding on to .
*CHI:	branches branches that's what it was .
*CHI:	I can't I'm hm can't remember so much well ∙hhh uhm uhm .
*CHI:	so yeah he's holding on to the antlers uh and uh h he has no idea
	that it's uhm probably a uhm uhm uh he he pro he I'm sure he doesn't
	know that uh it's a reindeer uhm because uh like yeah I I wouldn't
	know .
*CHI:	I don't think uhm yeah anyway .
*CHI:	so in this picture uhm uhm the mm hhh∙ uh .
*CHI:	rou something .
*CHI:	sorry uh the uhm uhm yeah uh sorr sorry uh so the uh the reindeer
	has uhm the boy on uh on his head and the .
*CHI:	you can't really see the boy's mouth in the picture but he looks
	pretty surprised to me uh just by the eyes and uhm the [?] dog is
	running crazy like he hh he I'm imagining he's like woo what's
	happening .
*CHI:	he [?] has no idea what it is and uhm (sniff) mmm he is uh kinda
	looking up at the reindeer while uh he's running really fast and in
	the picture you can just see the edge of this landscape .
*CHI:	it looks like a cliff kind of a little very little cliff .
*CHI:	in the next pixter there (laugh) pixter next picture uh in the next
	picture there is uhm uhm there is uhm yeah it's a picture of the
	reindeer stopping so hard .
*CHI:	you can just see how fast he's braking and stopping uh and and you

	reindeer stopping back then the uhm the [?] boy flies into this
	little river like not even a river it's it's that little .
