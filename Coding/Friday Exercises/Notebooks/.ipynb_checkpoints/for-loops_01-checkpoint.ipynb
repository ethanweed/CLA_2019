    "# Using *for*-loops to calculate MLU (in words)\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to practice using *for*-statements. We will use *for*-loops to calculate MLU in words, because this is easier than calculating MLU in morphemes. The procedure would be in principle the same, however. Working with morphemes is just harder, because it requires parsing tagged data, which can be a pain in the butt. So let's keep it simple.\n",

    "We can use the first cell or cells in the notebook to get our workspace set up. As an example, if we know that we will need certain packages, then it is nice to import them all at the beginning. Of course, we can always import them later, as needed. It can also make things easier to define some path variables at the beginning. I often use ``pathin`` to define where my data are going to come from, and ``pathout`` to define where files that the script creates will be saved. Putting these in variables at the top, rather than \"hard-coding\" them into your script makes it easier to keep track of, easier to call, and easier to change."

    "\n",
    "Part of the strength of Python is the many \"packages\" available, which are pre-written code that can do things for you. You can load these by writing ``import`` and then the name of the package. But you can also import *parts* of packages, and you can also give them new names. Often people import parts of packages and give them an abbreviation. There is a useful package called ``os`` which helps with navigating around in your file system, e.g. pointing to folders where data are stores. In the code below, I only import the part of ``os``called ``chdir``(\"change directory\"). Also *I* like to rename it ``cd``, because that is shorter, and it is the same command for changing directories in Unix. But you could call it whatever you like, or not change the name at all."
