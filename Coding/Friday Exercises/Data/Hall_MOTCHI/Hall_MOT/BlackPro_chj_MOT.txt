I know , but we know how it turns out , right
yeah
okay
but they're not real things
they're pretend things , right
they're just in this book
so anyway they shook hands , +...
+" and Sally and I did not know what to do , so we hadta shake
we shook their two hands but our fish said , n:o , no

here she is , up there
she's caught in the string
see
kuhz [: because] she didn't get out_of the way

I don't know
I think she's probably , a little uncomfortable
he's surprised
he still doesn't know what's going on
I don't think he's angry
does he look angry
in his house
I think the only one who doesn't want them there is that fish in
kuhz [: because] he's the one that kept saying , tell them to go ,
right

then those things ran about with big bumps , jumps , and kicks
and with haps [: hops] , and big thumps , and all kinds of bad
