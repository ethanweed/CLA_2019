nine fine gifts
I had a birthday not long ago
I got a_lot_of gifts , but none to show
for I lost them , all of them , nine of them
there were three flower seeds from the lady next door
three flower seeds from the lady next door
and two sugar cubes she had no more
an(d) a cocoon from a bush
red silk from a kite
and a squirrel who crawled into my room that night
what's this
mhm
aren't those fine , but that's eight not nine
there was another from my mother
an(d) it was best , better an(d) finer than all the rest
she made a jacket
for you know who , with big big pockets , deep one too
so_that was my birthday , part of it anyway
xxx I put eight of the gifts into one of my pockets of my new
the three flower seeds from the lady next door
an(d) two sugar cubes +...
(be)cause there were no more
the cocoon from a bush , red silk from the kite , and the squirrel
they hadta be to hold all those things
there's the squirrel in the pocket , the kite , the sugar cubes
well I walked down the path for it wasn't late
down the path to the garden gate an(d) that was why xxx
do you listen
I didn't take them out or shake them out they didn't fall out ,
because the squirrel you see lives in my jacket , was chewing an(d)
quiet as quiet
he chewed a little hole , not big but big enough
an(d) oh oh what do you know the seeds my lovely lovely flower
of course I still had the two sugar cubes , the cocoon from a bush
but not for long (be)cause the sugar cubes fell out +...
right on the hill right where we stopped
they both fell out with a plop plop plop
the hole in my pocket was a little bigger you see
an(d) that naughty little squirrel was quite busy gnawing an(d)
an(d) oh , oh what do you know the sugar cubes were gone
of course I still had the cocoon from the bush , red silk from the
well the woods were close_by so I took a look to see if there were
it looks like a carrot
that's suppose to be the cocoon from the bush
I took a look to see if there were fish in the clear clear cool
an(d) the hole in my pocket got bigger an(d) bigger
the squirrel chewed an(d) chewed
then oh oh , what do you know the cocoon fell out
what a birthday , well it really wasn't too bad , for I still had
it was getting late an(d) I was tired , but the squirrel wasn't no
an(d) oh oh what do you know
my red silk was gone too
but I still had the s:quirrel , the bad boy , who crawled into my
then he jumped out too
all of a sudden my pocket was empty
I put in my hand
there was nothing there , oh dear , no three flower seeds from the
just a jacket with a big bite out_of the pocket
what a birthday
how would you like a birthday like that
what would [//] if you do [//] if you lost all your birthday
hm:
well that's the nut for the squirrel
what are those
hm:
well that's a sugar bowl
so I went home
I put my jacket on my bed , and went to wash my face and hands
an(d) when I came back oh oh what do you know , even the jacket was
xxx well a few days later the jacket was back , all clean and
don't do that
I think it will
I never got the other things back
no sir , not the three flower seeds from the lady next door , +...
+, the two sugar cubes , not anymore
the cocoon from the bush , the red silk from the kite or the
I wished I'd [: I had] never seen him , who crawled into my room
don't do that
you want them to hear the story
I [//] they'll hear the story
oh , okay
I never got any of these things back , not exactly
maybe in a way I did
for one day in the woods from a hollow tree , a little squirrel
he shook his tail in a friendly way , and bobbed his head , as_if
so maybe I did find my squirrel after all
and further along in a xxx a bit of red color caught my eye
it flittered and fluttered and flashed in the breeze riding the
it just might have been that silk you know , the silk from a kite
an(d) that's alright with me
so maybe I did find my silk
then once as I bent above a brook , to try to catch a fish on bent
maybe it was from a cocoon I had found in the bush
of course I didn't find the sugar cube , but a little pony I
one day
so maybe they weren't really lost after all
last of all and this is best , better and finer than all the rest ,
something happened that was really great
first we see , the three seeds pushed their way up to be seen
and then the leaves popped out in threes , through up the rain
and flowers came an(d) they bloom and bloom
I watched them everyday and say +"/.
+" maybe I did find my flower seeds , after all
that's why next year when I have a birthday
this is what I hope I get , three flower seeds from the lady next
