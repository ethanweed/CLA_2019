mm

she watches the little man
what's this show
Jimminy_Cricket
why don't you set it up El because you go in the morning
he came home with Jimmy thing
hello
oh just a moment
El
one moment xxx
this is the time of the cave man
do you remember when we saw in the museum of the cave drawings ,
at the museum of modern art
they have that little cave
it's the same thing
only this is a cartoon
what's he using the fires look at the painting on the wall
what do you see Daniel
mm
what are they talking about Julia
haha [x 2] , what happened
what happened
y:es fire could be good
how could fire be good
Daniel
hm:
how did they start the fire
do you remember how they useta start it when they didn't have
rub sticks
rub sticks , very hard
the friction will do it
there they go
look , watch
watch
watch it
oh
see that
a spark
o:h , he's made a discovery
would you like to have lived then Julia
in a cave
nope
why not
there were wild animals , but , it was nice and snug and cozy in a
don't you think so
and you could draw on your own walls
I don't let you draw on the walls
you could draw on the walls in a cave
how about that
you could decorate your whole room
haha [x 2]
right
yeah it's a good reason
what's a bad reason
what's a reason against it
mm
what
yes
what
what fur
a person doesn't have fur
oh for [//] you mean the fur clo:thing
o:h
so in other words you mean you couldn't control a fire
they may get too large and get burned
that's true , they hadta be careful
well that's what they were saying in this little story
they were saying they learned how to put fires out
how do you put it out
do you remember
did you notice
how did the man put the fire out
no , blowing didn't put it out
blowing made it bigger
how did he put it out
how did he make it smaller
with what
something cold and wet
what
ri:ght
water
see when you blow on it , your mouth [//] the air that comes out_of
right
that makes the fire get +...
you know how
you use a damper
Julia , that damper we saw over the fireplace
and you squeeze the thing together , right
makes air , the same effect if you go +...
same thing
so you know one thing , if you ever are near a fire and it's
and if you wanna put it out , you don't do what
you don't blow on it , do you
that will make it
bigger
so what do you do
you go get some +...
cold , water
hm: [x 2]
good idea
or else the first thing you do is you call your mommy , if you see
can I feed you a little bit
it might fall off
well come here , come close
I'll give you a hand
come close
here's dinner
ready set , catch
okay
ready
come closer
o:h catch it all
very good
Julia what about you
what +...
what did he do
how did he put that fire out just now
in a most interesting way
what do you think happened when he turned the glass , when he
he turned it upside down and put it over the flame
what do you think happened to it
why do you think the fire went out
if you take this and you cover something with it , what do you keep
what are you keeping out
you're keeping out air
and fires need air , oxygen
mhm
so you could put a fire out by covering it
sometimes they tell you , you can put a fire out by using a heavy
but it's gotta [: has got to] be a heavy blanket because if it was
that's an electrical fire
Daniel are you ready for more

then mister carp told him when you feed a fish never feed him a lot
so much and no more
never more than a spot or something may happen
you never know , wha:t
then I took Otto home
I gave him some food
I didn't give him much just one little spot
but this did not make Otto happy

there was just one thing to do
I put Otto into the flower bowl

but no , the flower bowl couldn't hold him
and then he put him in a mommy's big pot
and then he put him in the biggest pot
and then he rushed up the stairs to get him to the +...
+, bath tub
at last there's Otto , I said
this tub holds my father
this tub holds my mother
so it will hold you
but pretty soon
Otto's too big for the tub
and he crashes down to the basement
look at this Daniel
and the little boy called the +...
he said help , help
I fed my fish too much

o:kay , I'm reading
Bambi never took his eyes off his mother as he walked with slo:w
he saw how she listened in all directions
then she called come
Bambi pounded out
joy seized him and he leaped into the air three , four , five times
catch me his mother cried and she bounded forward
Bambi started after her
he felt as_if they were flying without any effort
as he hopped for breath a large green frog suddenly hopped out_of
Ba:mbi followed it
hello , he said
don't be afraid Bambi his mother said , that's little Falline
his mother there they are with the other deer

and romping

they tore by like the wind , made a wi:de circle in the grassy
who are they

he could hear the sound of mice making a hole and he could smell
yea:h
and here winter came
and he learned all about ice the hard way didn't he
what happened
he slipped on the ice
and thumper thought it was a big joke

and pretty soon , early one morning when Bambi was asleep , there
and he jumped and followed him
