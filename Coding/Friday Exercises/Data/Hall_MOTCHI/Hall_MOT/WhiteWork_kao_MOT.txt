(.) mister and Missus Mallard were looking for a place to live
but every time mister Mallard saw what looked like a nice place ,
there was sure to be foxes in the wood or turtles in the water and
so they flew on and on
when they got to Boston , they felt too tired to fly any further
there was a nice pond in the public gardens with a little island on
the very place to spend the night quacked mister Mallard
so down they flapped
the next morning they fished for their breakfast in the mud at the
but they didn't find much
just as they were getting ready to start on their way , a strange
it was pushing a boat full of people
and there was a man sitting on it's back
good morning quacked mister Mallard , being polite
the big bird was too proud to answer
the people on the boat threw peanuts into the water so the mallards
I like this place said Missus Mallard as they climbed down on the
why don't we build a nest and raise our ducklings right in this
there are no foxes and no turtles , and the people feed us peanuts
what could be better
good said mister Mallard , delighted that at last mister Mallard
but look out squawked Missus Mallard all in a dither
you'll get run over
and when she got her breath , she added this is no place for babies
we'll hafta look somewhere else
what is that
right
so they flew over beacon hill and round the state house , but there
they looked in &weebrout square but there was no pl [//] water to
then they flew over the Charles river
this is better quacked Missus Mallard
that island looks like a nice quiet place
and it's only a little way from the public garden
yes said Missus Mallard , remembering the peanuts , that looks like
so they chose a cozy spot among the bushes near the water and
and only just in time
for now they were beginning to molt
all their old wing feathers started to drop out and they would not
but of course they could swim and one day they swam over to the
micharl [: Michael] fed them peanuts and after that the mallards
after Missus Mallard laid eight eggs in the nest she couldn't visit
she moved off the nest only to get a drink of water or to have her
one day the ducklings hatched out
first came Jack , then kack@wp , then lack@wp , then mack@wp and
Mister and Missus Mallard were bursting with pride
it was a great responsibility taking care of so many ducklings and
(.) are you interested in this story
would you like me to read some more
okay
one day mister Mallard decided he would like to take a trip to see
so off he set
I'll meet you in a week in the public garden , he quacked over his
take good care of the ducklings
don't you worry said Missus Mallard , I know all about bringing up
and she did
she taught them how to swim and dive
she taught them to walk in a line , to come when they were called
when at last she felt perfectly satisfied with them she said one
before you could wink an eyelash Jack , kack@wp , lack@wp , mack@wp
Missus Mallard led the way into the water and they swam behind her
there they waded ashore and waded along until they came to the
Missus Mallard stepped out to cross the road
honk honk went the horns on the speeding cars
quack went Missus Mallard as she tumbled back again
quack quack quack quack went Jack kack@wp lack@wp mack@wp nack@wp
the cars kept speeding by and honking and Missus Mallard and the
they made such a noise that Michael came running waving his arms
he planted himself in the center of the road , raised one hand to
as_soon_as Missus Mallard and the ducklings were safe on the other
he called Clancey at headquarters and said there's a family of
Clancey said family of what
ducks yelled Michael , send a police car quick
meanwhile , Missus Mallard had reached the corner book shop and
everyone stared
an old lady from beacon hill said isn't it amazing
then the man who swept the streets said well ain't that nice
and when Missus Mallard heard them she was so proud , she
when they came to the corner of beacon street , there was the
the policemen held back the traffic so Missus Mallard and the
inside the gates they all turned around to say thank_you to the
the policemen smiled and waved goodbye
did you ever know any policeman who did that
let a family of ducks walk by
I never did either
when they reached the pond and swam across the little island ,
the ducklings liked the new island so much that they decided to
all day long they follow the swan boat and eat peanuts
and when night falls , they swim to their little island and go to
Canada
California
Virginia
